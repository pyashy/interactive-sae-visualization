","2","0","0","9",")."," Venom","ous"," animals"," predominantly"," occur"," in"," terrestrial"," and"," aquatic"," ecosystems"," where"," prey"," items"," are"," abundant"," and"," diverse"," (","Case","well"," et"," al",".,"," ","2","0","1","3",").","\n\n","One"," of"," the"," key"," reasons"," for"," the"," higher"," concentration"," of"," venomous"," species"," in"," warm"," environments"," is"," the"," temperature","-","dependent"," enzyme"," activity"," in"," ven","oms","."," Enzymes"," are"," crucial"," components"," of"," ven","oms",","," and"," their"," activity","
