The"," claim"," is"," that"," if"," we","'","re"," able"," to"," find"," such"," a"," z",","," then"," the"," generator"," can"," generate"," this"," particular"," training"," example",".","

the"," proposed"," metric","."," And"," due"," to"," Cantor","'","s"," proof"," of"," equivalence"," between"," all"," powers"," of"," real"," spaces",","," this"," applies"," to"," smaller","
