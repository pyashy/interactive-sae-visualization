{"text_id":227057,"tokens":["The"," impact"," of"," limiting"," car"," usage"," on"," car"," companies"," and"," the"," environment"," is"," a"," topic"," of"," significant"," debate","."," While","

significant"," contributor"," to"," air"," pollution"," (","EPA",","," ","2","0","2","0",")."," By"," reducing"," the"," number"," of"," cars"," on"," the"," road",","," we"," can"," decrease","
