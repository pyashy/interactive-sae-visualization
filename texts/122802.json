","\n\n","The"," first"," step"," in"," appealing"," a"," summary"," judgment"," is"," to"," understand"," the"," requirements"," that"," must"," be"," met","."," In"," order"," to"," appeal"," a"," summary"," judgment",","," your"," appeal"," must"," be"," based"," on"," a"," legal"," question"," of"," the"," judge","'","s"," ruling","."," That"," means"," the"," focus"," of"," your"," appeal"," should"," be"," to"," argue"," that"," the"," judge"," made"," a"," mistake"," of"," some"," kind","."," Generally",","," you"," must"," show"," that"," the"," judge"," lacked"," jurisdiction",","," (","or"," authority",")"," to"," issue"," the"," ruling",","," the"," judge"," applied"," an"," incorrect"," law"," or"," mis","applied"," the"," law",","," or"," the"," judge"," made"," an"," error"," of"," fact"," or"," procedure","."," ","\n\n","The"," next"," step"," is"," to"," read"," the"," judge","\u2019","s"," ruling","."," This"," is"," important"," in"," order"," to"," understand"," the"," basis"," of"," the"," ruling"," and"," be"," sure"," that"," it"," is"," indeed"," an"," appeal","able"," offense","."," You"," will"," need"," to"," search"," the"," ruling"," for"," any"," exceptions"," that"," could"," make"," the"," ruling"," appeal","able","."," If"," exceptions"," are"," found",","," then"," research"," the"," laws"," to"," support"," your"," argument"," that"," the"," judge"," made"," a"," legal"," error","."," ","\n\n","The"," evidence"," is"," an"," essential"," element"," of"," the"," appeal","."," In"," order"," to"," appeal"," a"," summary"," judgment",","," there"," must"," be"," some"," evidence"," that"," goes"," beyond"," or"," contradicts"," the"," statement"," of"," facts"," given"," in"," the"," judge","\u2019","s"," ruling","."," It"," is"," important"," to"," review"," all"," the"," evidence"," that"," was"," provided"," in"," the"," case"," to"," decide"," if"," there"," is"," a"," legal"," error"," that","

party","."," You"," must"," provide"," them"," with"," a"," copy"," of"," the"," Notice"," and"," all"," supporting"," paperwork"," that"," goes"," with"," it","."," ","\n\n","Then",","," file"," a","

that"," will"," govern"," the"," case","."," ","\n\n","The"," next"," step"," is"," to"," order"," transcripts","."," You"," must"," order"," transcripts"," of"," any"," hearings"," or"," trials","
