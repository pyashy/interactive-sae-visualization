{"text_id":130466,"tokens":["Balancing"," redox"," (","oxidation","-","reduction",")"," reactions"," is"," a"," key"," skill"," for"," a"," chemistry"," student","."," Red","ox"," reactions"," occur"," between"," two"," species"," when"," electrons"," are"," exchanged"," between"," them","."," This"," tutorial"," will"," explain"," the"," rules"," for"," assigning"," oxidation"," states",","," the"," method"," for"," devising"," half","-","reactions",","," and"," how"," to"," balance"," the"," equation","."," ","\n","In"," order"," to"," balance"," a"," redox"," reaction",","," you"," must"," first"," assign"," an"," oxidation"," state"," to"," each"," element","."," The"," oxidation"," state"," of"," an"," element"," in"," a"," compound"," or"," molecule"," is"," the"," total"," charge"," of"," the"," element","."," A"," positive"," oxidation"," number"," identifies"," the"," element"," as"," an"," oxidizing"," agent"," and"," a"," negative"," number"," identifies"," the"," element"," as"," a"," reducing"," agent","."," To"," assign"," oxidation"," numbers",","," you"," must"," follow"," a"," set"," of"," rules",":"," ","\n","The"," oxidation"," number"," of"," an"," element"," in"," its"," elemental"," form"," is"," zero","."," ","\n","The"," sum"," of"," oxidation"," numbers"," of"," all"," elements"," in"," a"," neutral"," compound"," is"," zero","."," ","\n","The"," sum"," of"," oxidation"," numbers"," in"," an"," ionic"," compound"," is"," equal"," to"," the"," charge"," of"," that"," ion","."," ","\n","The"," oxidation"," number"," of"," hydrogen"," is"," +","1",","," except"," when"," it"," is"," combined"," with"," a"," metal"," (","such"," as"," Na"," as"," in"," NaOH","),"," in"," which"," case"," it"," is"," -","1","."," ","\n","The"," oxidation"," number"," of"," oxygen"," is"," -","2",","," except"," in"," perox","ides"," (","H","2","O","2","),"," in"," which"," case"," it"," is"," -","1","."," ","\n","Once"," you"," have"," assigned"," the"," oxidation"," states",","," you"," need"," to"," split"," the"," reaction"," into"," two"," half","-","reactions","."," One"," half","-","reaction"," will"," involve"," the"," species"," that"," is"," oxidized",","," and"," the"," other"," will"," involve"," the"," species"," that"," is"," reduced","."," The"," reactants"," that"," are"," being"," oxidized"," will"," be"," written"," on"," the"," left"," side"," of"," the"," equation",","," and"," the"," reactants"," that"," are"," being"," reduced"," are"," written"," on"," the"," right"," side","."," ","\n","Next",","," you"," must"," balance"," all"," the"," elements"," in"," the"," equation"," except"," hydrogen"," and"," oxygen","."," This"," can"," be"," done"," by"," adding"," the"," same"," number"," of"," atoms"," on"," both"," sides","."," If"," the"," equation"," involves"," charges",","," these"," should"," also"," be"," equal","ized"," on"," both"," sides","."," ","\n","Now"," it"," is"," time"," to"," balance"," the"," hydrogen"," atoms"," and"," oxygen"," atoms","."," To"," balance"," the"," oxygen"," atoms",","," add"," the"," compound"," H","2","O"," (","water",")"," to"," the"," opposite"," side"," of"," the"," equation","."," To"," balance"," the"," hydrogen"," atoms",","," you"," will"," need"," to"," add"," the"," compound"," H","+"," (","hydrogen"," ion",")"," to"," the"," opposite"," side"," of"," the"," equation","."," ","\n","The"," next"," step"," is"," to"," equal","ize"," the"," charges","."," To"," do"," this",","," add"," electrons"," to"," the"," side"," of"," the"," equation"," with"," the"," majority"," of"," the"," positive"," charge","."," ","\n","Once"," you"," have"," balanced"," the"," equation",","," you"," will"," now"," need"," to"," make"," sure"," the"," number"," of"," electrons"," is"," equal"," on"," both"," sides","."," To"," do"," this",","," you"," will"," need"," to"," multiply"," both"," sides"," of"," the"," half","-","reactions"," by"," a"," scaling"," factor"," so"," that"," the"," electrons"," are"," equal","."," ","\n","Finally",","," you"," can"," combine"," the"," two"," half","-","reactions"," to"," create"," the"," balanced"," redox"," equation","."," The"," last"," step"," in"," the"," balancing"," process"," is"," to"," double","-","check"," that"," each"," side"," of"," your"," equation"," has"," the"," same"," charge","."," It"," is"," also"," important"," to"," balance"," the"," positive"," hydrogen"," ions"," with"," negative"," hydroxyl"," ions",","," if"," your"," reaction"," is"," in"," a"," basic"," solution","."," ","\n","Balancing"," redox"," reactions"," can"," be"," a"," tricky"," task",","," but"," following"," the"," steps"," outlined"," in"," this"," tutorial"," should"," make"," the"," process"," easier","."," Be"," sure"," to"," follow"," each"," of"," the"," steps",","," and"," double","-","check"," the"," equation","
