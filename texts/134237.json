{"text_id":134237,"tokens":["The"," Facial"," Action"," Coding"," System"," (","FAC","S",")"," is"," a"," technology"," developed"," by"," Dr","."," Paul"," Ek","man"," that"," del","ves"," into"," the"," relationship"," between"," facial"," movements"," and"," emotions","."," This"," system"," involves"," a"," comprehensive"," catalog"," of"," distinct"," facial"," movements",","," gau","ging"," the"," muscle"," activity"," involved"," in"," each"," movement"," across"," different"," areas"," of"," the"," face","."," ","\n","One"," of"," the"," key"," advantages"," of"," FAC","S"," lies"," in"," its"," ability"," to"," aid"," students"," in"," identifying"," emotions","."," By"," equipping"," students"," with"," the"," skill"," to"," decipher"," emotions"," through"," facial"," movements",","," this"," technology"," could"," potentially"," enhance"," their"," emotional"," intelligence","."," For"," instance",","," pupils"," could"," learn"," to"," recognize"," when"," a"," classmate"," is"," feeling"," uncomfortable"," or"," distressed",","," thus"," enabling"," them"," to"," take"," appropriate"," action",".","\n","FAC","S"," identifies"," six"," fundamental"," emotions"," that"," are"," intertwined"," with"," specific"," facial"," movements","."," These"," six"," emotions"," consist"," of",":"," ","\n","1","."," Happiness"," -"," portrayed"," by"," a"," smile"," characterised"," by"," the"," lifting"," of"," the"," cheeks"," and"," cr","inkling"," of"," the"," eyes","\n","2","."," Sad","ness"," -"," expressed"," through"," downward","-","turned"," lips"," and"," drooping"," eyelids","\n","3","."," Fear"," -"," revealed"," by"," widened"," eyes"," and"," raised"," eyebrows",","," potentially"," accompanied"," by"," a"," mouth"," that"," may"," be"," slightly"," open","\n","4","."," Dis","gust"," -"," shown"," through"," a"," wrinkled"," nose"," and"," lowered"," eyebrows","\n","5","."," Anger"," -"," typically"," displayed"," through"," a"," furrowed"," brow"," and"," clenched"," teeth","\n","6","."," Surprise"," -"," manifested"," as"," widened"," eyes"," and"," a"," mouth"," left"," open"," in"," astonishment","\n","Among","st"," its"," many"," applications",","," FAC","S"," has"," the"," potential"," to"," enhance"," emotional"," communication","."," This"," technology"," could"," prove"," to"," be"," particularly"," advantageous"," for"," individuals"," who"," struggle"," to"," convey"," their"," emotions"," through"," verbal"," communication","."," For"," example",","," pupils"," who"," suffer"," from"," conditions"," like"," autism"," or"," selective"," mu","tism"," may"," find"," FAC","S"," to"," be"," an"," invaluable"," tool"," that"," helps"," them"," better"," articulate"," their"," feelings","."," ","\n","Furthermore",","," FAC","S"," has"," the"," capacity"," to"," reshape"," the"," approach"," to"," teaching"," and"," learning","."," By"," helping"," educators"," become"," more"," adept"," at"," reading"," their"," students","'"," emotions",","," FAC","S"," could"," prompt"," teachers"," to"," adjust"," their"," teaching"," methods","."," For"," instance",","," if"," a"," teacher"," notices"," that"," their"," explanation"," of"," a"," concept"," is"," causing"," confusion"," among"," students",","," they"," could"," real","ign"," their"," approach"," to"," better"," meet"," the"," needs"," of"," their"," students","."," ","\n","However",","," FAC","S"," is"," not"," without"," its"," limitations","."," One"," of"," the"," primary"," drawbacks"," of"," this"," technology"," is"," its"," propensity"," to"," perpetuate"," stereotypes","."," Given"," that"," FAC","S"," relies"," on"," categorical"," associations"," between"," facial"," movements"," and"," emotions",","," there"," is"," a"," risk"," of"," reinforcing"," rigid"," notions"," of"," how"," specific"," emotions"," should"," be"," expressed","."," ","\n","Furthermore",","," the"," applicability"," of"," FAC","S"," may"," be"," restricted"," to"," certain"," cohorts"," of"," students","."," This"," technology"," could"," be"," particularly"," advantageous"," for"," pupils"," who"," are"," visually"," oriented"," learners","."," However",","," for"," individuals"," who"," learn"," best"," through"," other"," modalities",","," such"," as"," auditory"," or"," kin","esthetic"," methods",","," FAC","S"," may"," not"," yield"," the"," same"," results","."," ","\n","In"," conclusion",","," FAC","S",","," a"," system"," that"," correlates"," facial"," movements"," with"," emotions",","," offers"," a"," range"," of"," benefits"," for"," students"," looking"," to"," recognize"," and"," articulate"," their"," feelings","."," Nevertheless",","," its"," limitations"," must"," be"," taken"," into"," account",","," particularly"," its"," potential"," to"," reinforce"," stereotypes"," and"," its"," applicability","
