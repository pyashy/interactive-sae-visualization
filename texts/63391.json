{"text_id":63391,"tokens":["The"," bane"," of"," hearing"," is"," sound","."," All"," the"," sounds"," you"," normally"," hear"," become"," a"," blanket"," that"," prevents"," you"," from"," hearing"," individual"," things","."," Noise"," canceling"," headphones"," \"","cancel"," noise","\""," by"," listening"," to"," the"," world"," and"," then"," playing"," the"," \"","opposite"," sound",".\""," So"," if"," you"," put"," your"," hand"," in"," front"," of"," a"," big"," speaker"," playing"," low"," tones"," you"," can"," feel"," the"," sound"," push"," and"," pull"," your"," hand","."," The"," noise"," canceling"," is"," adding"," a"," \"","pull","\""," to"," match"," each"," \"","push","\""," and"," then"," a"," \"","push","\""," to"," match"," each"," pull","."," Higher"," tones"," don","'","t"," move"," as"," much"," air"," with"," the"," same"," power"," but"," they"," do"," it"," more"," often","."," This"," is"," why"," we"," measure"," tones"," in"," \"","frequency","\""," and"," volume"," in"," \"","amplitude",",\""," it","'","s"," how"," often"," and"," how"," far"," each"," push","pull"," goes","."," The"," better"," the"," gear"," the"," faster"," it"," can"," process"," what"," it"," hears"," and"," so"," the"," more"," effective"," it"," becomes"," at"," canceling"," shorter"," and"," higher","-","pitched"," sounds","."," So"," anyway",","," the"," noise"," best"," canceled"," is"," regular"," repeating"," noise","."," Things"," that"," go"," hum","mmmmmm"," and"," wi","rrrrrrrr"," and"," buzz","zzzz"," because"," the"," canceling"," algorithms"," can"," work"," on"," repeating"," \"","r","\""," and"," \"","z","\""," and"," \"","m","\""," of"," the"," noise","."," Music"," goes"," did","d","lie","dee","ber","pb"," and"," so"," most"," of"," it"," can","'","t"," be"," canceled"," as"," well","."," Some"," of"," it"," may"," even"," be"," reinforced"," because"," of"," the"," expectation"," the"," \"","ee","\""," or"," \"","dd","\""," bits"," might"," be"," the"," start"," of"," a"," longer"," noise"," and"," the"," anti","-","e"," and"," anti","-","d"," starts"," up"," and"," then"," the"," real"," de","

at"," hearing"," sounds"," when"," it","'","s"," not"," swamp","ed"," with"," noise","."," The"," unc","anceled"," and"," possibly"," reinforced"," did","d","ily","dee"," will"," have"," enough"," of"," its"," sound","-","shape"," get"," through"," that"," your"," brain"," will"," fill"," in"," the"," parts"," that"," did"," get"," canceled"," or"," were"," weaker"," than"," normal"," and"," so"," it"," will"," fill"," in"," the"," gaps"," and"," you","'","ll"," think"," you"," heard"," more"," of"," the"," music"," than"," actually"," came"," in"," through"," your"," ears","."," So"," basically"," its"," a"," three"," phase"," thing","."," (","1",")"," all"," the"," constant"," sounds"," are"," cut"," down","."," (","2",")"," the"," rapidly"," changing"," sound"," may"," be","

even"," as"," it"," listens"," more"," aggressively"," to"," weaker"," sounds","."," You"," know"," how",","," when"," you"," turn"," on"," the"," noise"," canceling",","," the"," fake"," silence"," makes"," the"," room"," sound"," bigger"," (","for"," most"," people"," anyway",")"," or"," oddly"," proportioned","?"," Your"," ears"," are"," a"," big"," part"," of"," your"," sense"," of"," space","."," Now"," if"," you"," go"," to"," the"," grocery"," or"," drug"," store"," and"," get"," regular"," ear"," plugs"," from"," the"," sleep","-","aid"," section"," (","typically"," ","3","3","db"," rated",")"," and"," put"," those"," in"," the"," room"," will"," feel"," really"," small"," or"," you"," might"," suddenly"," feel"," like"," you","'","ve"," got"," a"," cold","."," But"," here","'","s"," the"," weird","est"," part","."," Once"," you"," get"," over"," the"," \"","Stu","ffy"," Head","\""," feeling",","," if"," you"," decide"," you"," can"," hear"," you","'","ll","

\"","everything"," is"," quieter","\""," your"," brain"," gets"," a"," better"," chance"," to"," selectively"," filter"," the"," signals"," of"," choice"," from"," what"," does"," get","
