{"text_id":193526,"tokens":["The"," Electoral"," College"," system"," has"," been"," a"," defining"," feature"," of"," presidential"," elections"," in"," the"," United"," States"," since"," the","

discou","rages"," the"," election"," of"," a"," president"," who"," is"," popular"," in"," only"," a"," few"," heavily"," populated"," states","."," Additionally",","," the"," Electoral"," College"," system"," ensures"," that"," small"," states"," have"," a"," voice"," in"," the"," election",","," as"," each"," state"," is"," given"," a"," minimum"," of"," three"," electoral"," votes",",","

is"," to"," move"," to"," a"," popular"," vote"," system",","," in"," which"," the"," candidate"," who"," receives"," the"," most"," votes"," nationwide"," wins"," the"," presidency","."," This","
