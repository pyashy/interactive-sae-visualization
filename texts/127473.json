it"," is"," crucial"," to"," create"," an"," accurate"," material"," list","."," This"," guide"," will"," help"," you"," break"," down"," the"," layout"," of"," your"," fence"," into"," smaller","

B","\n\n","Starting"," from"," point"," A"," to"," point"," B",","," measure"," the"," length"," of"," the"," fence"," run"," and"," note"," it"," down","."," This"," measurement"," will"," help"," you"," determine"," the"," number"," of"," panels"," and"," posts"," required"," for"," this"," section"," of"," the"," fence",".","\n\n","####"," Step"," ","2",":"," Point"," B"," to"," Point"," C"," (","Gate"," Installation",")","\n\n","From"," point"," B"," to"," point"," C",","," we"," have"," a"," ","4","-","foot","-","wide"," gate","."," The"," width"," is"," measured"," from"," the"," inside"," of"," one"," gate"," post"," to"," the"," inside"," of"," the"," other"," gate"," post",","," which"," is"," point"," C","."," Since"," we"," have"," already"," added"," the"," first","

","7"," panels","\n","-"," ","7"," line"," posts"," (","One"," post"," for"," each"," panel",").","\n\n","####"," Step"," ","5",":"," Point"," E"," to"," Point"," F"," (","Gate","
