skin","ning"," animals"," and"," killing"," rivals","."," And"," because"," we"," were"," still"," very"," primitive",","," we"," made"," hand","-","axes"," by"," simply"," bashing"," a"," flint"," rock"," against"," another"," flint"," rock","."," So"," if"," you"," see"," a"," hand","-","axe"," now",","," you","'","ll"," notice"," that"," one"," side"," of"," it"," is"," very"," sharp",","," and"," the"," other"," side"," is"," all"," mus","hed"," up","."," This"," is"," because"," it"," was"," made"," by"," hitting"," it",","," not"," by"," shaping"," it","."," But"," about"," ","1","0",",","0","0","0"," years"," ago",","," something"," new"," happened","."," We"," developed"," language","."," And"," that"," gave"," us"," the"," ability"," to"," communicate","."," And"," that"," meant"," that"," we"," no"," longer"," had"," to"," spend"," all"," our"," time"," hunting"," and"," gathering","."," Instead",","," we"," could"," specialise","."," One"," person"," could"," grow"," food",","," while"," another"," could"," weave"," baskets",","," and"," another"," could"," go"," and"," get"," honey",","," and"," another"," could"," make"," musical"," instruments","."," And"," this"," meant"," that"," people"," could"," do"," what"," they"," were"," good"," at","."," And"," because"," people"," could"," specialise",","," they"," could"," start"," to"," become","

hunter","-","gather","er","."," Some"," people"," preferred"," to"," stay"," at"," home"," and"," look"," after"," their"," families","."," And"," so"," they"," became"," the"," first","

housewives"," knew"," what"," to"," buy","."," And"," so"," they"," developed"," the"," first"," trading"," systems","."," And"," because"," we"," were"," living"," in"," larger"," groups",","," we"," needed"," some"," way"," of"," organising"," ourselves","."," And"," this"," was"," when"," the"," first"," leaders"," emerged","."," The"," most"," powerful"," leader"," was"," the"," most","

for"," his"," family",","," and"," so"," he"," could"," have"," the"," most"," wives",","," and"," so"," his"," family"," would"," be"," the"," biggest",","," and"," so"," he"," would"," be"," the"," most"," powerful","."," And"," this"," is"," where"," the"," first"," kings"," and"," queens"," came"," from","."," And"," of"," course",","," kings"," and"," queens"," needed"," money","."," And"," they"," couldn","'","t"," just"," print"," it"," like"," we"," do"," today",","," because"," money"," was"," made"," of"," precious"," metals"," like"," gold"," and"," silver","."," So"," they"," had"," to"," tax"," their"," subjects","."," And"," because"," they"," needed"," money",","," they"," were"," willing"," to"," sell"," land"," to"," people",","," and"," tax"," them"," on"," the"," land","."," And"," so"," the"," first"," landowners"," were"," born","."," But"," because"," you"," needed"," to"," be"," able"," to"," read"," and"," write"," in"," order"," to"," do"," all"," these"," jobs",","," a"," lot"," of"," people"," were"," illiterate","."," And"," so"," the"," first"," religious"," leaders"," came"," along",","," who"," would"," read"," out"," the"," news"," and"," tell"," people"," what"," was"," going"," on","."," And"," of"," course",","," these"," religious"," leaders"," needed"," to"," be"," able"," to"," speak"," to"," God",","," and"," so"," the","

you"," had"," a"," town",","," you"," needed"," to"," be"," able"," to"," defend"," it",","," which"," meant"," that"," you"," needed"," to"," be"," able"," to"," attack"," other"," towns","."," And"," so"," the"," first"," weapons"," came"," along","."," And"," because"," you"," needed"," to"," be"," able"," to"," kill"," your"," enemies",","," you"," needed"," some"," way"," of","

this"," meant"," that"," the"," first"," weapons"," could"," be"," made"," in"," large"," numbers",","," and"," they"," could"," be"," made"," to"," fit"," our"," hands","."," And"," so"," the","
