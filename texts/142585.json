to"," live"," by"," its"," principles"," in"," legal",","," social",","," political",","," economic",","," and"," cultural"," terms"," are"," not"," Muslims","?\""," The"," answer"," is"," simple",":"," They"," are"," not","."," In"," other"," words",","," when"," people"," see"," someone"," practicing"," his"," religion"," -"," a"," practice"," which"," has"," been"," around"," for"," thousands"," of"," years",","," with"," many"," forms",","," including"," prose","ly","tizing"," and"," prose","ly","tization","ism"," -"," in"," an"," Islamic"," context",","," they"," think"," it"," means"," he","'","s"," Muslim","."," But"," because"," Islam"," is"," so"," flexible"," about"," what"," constitutes"," acceptable"," behavior"," within"," a"," given"," society"," or"," religious"," culture",","," no"," one"," knows"," exactly"," how"," a"," person"," will"," react"," when"," confronted"," with"," certain"," rules"," in"," another"," belief"," system","."," So"," instead"," of"," assuming"," that"," all"," Muslims"," must"," be"," \"","good",",\""," it"," would"," be"," better"," to"," assume"," that"," some"," may"," choose"," to"," break"," their"," covenant"," with"," God"," if"," they"," feel"," that"," things"," aren","'","t"," working"," out"," as"," they","'","d"," hoped","."," And"," while"," this"," might"," seem"," like"," a"," good"," thing"," from"," a"," humanitarian"," standpoint",","," there","'","s"," a"," danger"," here"," too",","," since"," these"," people"," don","'","t"," necessarily"," choose"," Islam"," on"," faith"," alone",";"," rather",","," they","'","re"," following"," their"," own"," values"," -"," and"," sometimes"," even"," their"," own"," sense"," of"," right"," and"," wrong"," -"," to"," suit"," themselves","."," That"," could"," make"," them"," less"," likely"," than"," others"," to"," adhere"," strictly"," to"," Islamic"," teachings"," (","which"," tend"," to"," demand"," modesty"," dress"," codes",","," communal"," living",","," women"," remaining"," at"," home","),"," but"," more"," open","-","minded"," enough"," that"," they"," won","'","t"," mind"," if"," ji","ha","dis"," exploit"," situations"," where"," they"," are"," forced"," into"," conflict"," with"," the"," law","."," In"," short",","," our"," policy"," response"," should"," be"," one"," of"," tolerance",","," rather"," than","

\"","ji","ha","dist","\""," is"," offensive"," or"," insulting",","," because"," it"," implies"," that"," Muslims"," believe"," killing"," non","belie","vers"," is"," somehow"," intrinsically"," virtuous","."," But"," this"," isn","'","t"," true",":"," Even"," if"," you"," agree"," that"," such"," violence"," does"," not"," represent"," the"," essence"," of"," Islam"," itself",","," there","'","s"," still"," nothing"," inherently"," objectionable"," about"," using"," the"," word"," ji","hadi","."," If"," anything",","," in"," fact",","," the"," opposite"," is"," often"," true",":"," Jihad"," -"," the"," Arabic"," word"," used"," for"," fighting"," in"," every"," single"," instance"," English"," speakers"," use"," it"," in"," any"," sort"," of"," context"," -"," has"," long"," been"," associated"," with"," Muslim"," armies"," in"," history",","," both"," military"," and"," political","."," It"," particularly"," refers"," to"," violent"," struggle"," against"," subjug","ation"," by"," force"," or"," terror","."," And"," yes",","," I"," realize"," that"," this"," connection"," may"," sound"," odd"," coming"," from"," an"," American"," Christian"," blog",","," but"," consider"," the"," tragic"," example"," of"," al"," Qaeda"," leader"," Osama"," bin"," Laden"," himself","."," Not"," only"," did"," he"," associate"," ji","had"," with"," war"," in"," general",","," terrorism"," specifically",","," and"," martyrdom"," in"," particular"," (","so"," much"," so"," that"," Allah"," pun","ishes"," anyone"," who"," kills"," him"," during"," battle","),"," but"," he"," also"," called"," on"," his"," followers"," to"," fight"," until"," death"," with"," zeal"," and"," determination"," regardless"," of"," whether"," they"," were"," Christians",","," Jews",","," Zoro","ast","rians",","," Hindus"," -"," or"," something"," else"," entirely","."," Bin"," Laden"," also"," repeatedly"," stressed"," the"," importance"," of"," using","
