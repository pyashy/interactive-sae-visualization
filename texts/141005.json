of"," the"," most"," significant"," flaws"," in"," the"," current"," system"," is"," its"," built","-","in"," bias"," towards"," swing"," states"," and"," urban"," areas","."," The"," electoral"," college"," system"," alloc","ates"," a"," fixed"," number"," of"," votes"," to"," each"," state",","," with"," the"," number"," of"," votes"," proportional"," to"," the"," state","'","s","
