skip"," things"," by"," omitting"," almost"," all"," of"," that","."," The"," only"," reason"," to"," shoot"," ","2","5"," (","or"," ","5","0",")"," is"," if"," you"," live"," in"," a"," PAL"," country"," *","and","*"," you","'","re"," shooting"," for"," television","."," If"," you"," aren","'","t"," shooting"," for"," television",","," you"," aren","'","t"," locked"," into"," the"," ","5","0"," Hz"," time","base",","," meaning"," you"," aren","'","t"," stuck"," with"," ","2","5"," or"," ","5","0",".","\n\n","You"," should"," never"," shoot"," ","3","0","p"," at"," all","."," The"," reasons"," are"," technical"," and"," complex",","," but"," the"," short"," version"," is"," that"," shooting"," ","3","0","p"," ro","bs"," you"," of"," all"," the"," virtues"," of","

if"," you"," want"," to"," read"," up"," on"," that",")"," is"," a"," mis","be","gotten"," derivative"," of"," regular"," ","6","0","i",","," and"," should"," be"," avoided"," in"," all"," cases","

should"," be"," avoided","."," In"," actual"," television"," production",","," we"," never"," work"," in"," an"," inter","laced"," format","."," Inter","laced"," formats"," are"," required"," for","

","6","0","i"," is"," just"," needlessly"," fin","nick","y"," and"," annoying",".","\n\n"," >","  ","If"," I"," shoot"," at"," ","2","4","p",","," is"," it"," generally"," accepted"," that"," my","

","1","0","8","0","i","?","\n\n","No",","," neither"," of"," those"," things"," is"," true",".","\n\n","Whether"," you"," shoot"," ","7","2","0"," or"," ","1","0","8","0"," is"," a"," matter"," of","
