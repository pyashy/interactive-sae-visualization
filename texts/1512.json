{"text_id":1512,"tokens":["In"," recent"," years",","," online"," learning"," has"," become"," an"," increasingly"," popular"," alternative"," to"," traditional"," brick","-","and","-","mortar"," education","."," While"," there"," are"," certainly"," advantages"," to"," attending"," classes"," in"," person",","," there"," are"," also"," many"," potential"," benefits"," to"," attending"," classes"," online"," from"," home",","," particularly"," for"," students"," who"," are"," sick"," or"," have"," experienced"," bullying"," or"," assault",".","\n\n","One"," of"," the"," most"," significant"," benefits"," of"," online"," learning"," for"," sick"," students"," is"," the"," ability"," to"," continue"," their"," education"," without"," the"," risk"," of"," spreading"," illness"," to"," others","."," Students"," who"," are"," dealing"," with"," contagious"," conditions",","," such"," as"," the"," flu"," or"," a"," cold",","," can"," still"," participate"," in"," class"," and"," keep"," up"," with"," their"," studies"," without"," putting"," their"," classmates"," at"," risk","."," This"," is"," not"," only"," beneficial"," for"," the"," sick"," student",","," but"," also"," for"," the"," overall"," health"," of"," the"," school"," community",".","\n\n","In"," addition"," to"," protecting"," the"," health"," of"," other"," students",","," online"," learning"," also"," allows"," sick"," students"," to"," rest"," and"," recover"," at"," their"," own"," pace","."," Rather"," than"," pushing"," themselves"," to"," attend"," school"," and"," potentially"," worsening"," their"," condition",","," sick"," students"," can"," work"," on"," their"," assignments"," from"," the"," comfort"," of"," their"," own"," homes",","," taking"," breaks"," as"," needed","."," This"," can"," lead"," to"," a"," faster"," and"," more"," effective"," recovery",","," as"," the"," student"," is"," able"," to"," get"," the"," rest"," they"," need",".","\n\n","Another"," group"," of"," students"," who"," can"," benefit"," from"," online"," learning"," are"," those"," who"," have"," experienced"," bullying"," or"," assault","."," For"," these"," students",","," the"," traditional"," classroom"," environment"," can"," be"," a"," source"," of"," stress"," and"," anxiety","."," By"," attending"," classes"," online",","," they"," can"," avoid"," the"," negative"," social"," interactions"," that"," may"," be"," causing"," them"," distress",".","\n\n","Online"," learning"," provides"," a"," safe"," and"," secure"," environment"," for"," these"," students",","," where"," they"," can"," focus"," on"," their"," studies"," without"," the"," fear"," of"," being"," bullied"," or"," harassed","."," This"," can"," help"," to"," reduce"," the"," negative"," impact"," that"," bullying"," or"," assault"," can"," have"," on"," a"," student","'","s"," mental"," health"," and"," well","-","being",".","\n\n","Furthermore",","," online"," learning"," can"," also"," provide"," a"," sense"," of"," control"," and"," empowerment"," for"," students"," who"," have"," been"," bullied"," or"," assaulted","."," In"," a"," traditional"," classroom",","," students"," have"," little"," control"," over"," their"," learning"," environment"," and"," are"," often"," at"," the"," mercy"," of"," their"," peers","."," However",","," in"," an"," online"," learning"," environment",","," students"," have"," more"," control"," over"," their"," learning"," experience","."," They"," can"," choose"," when"," and"," where"," they"," want"," to"," work",","," and"," can"," tailor"," their"," learning"," environment"," to"," suit"," their"," needs"," and"," preferences","."," This"," can"," help"," to"," boost"," their"," confidence"," and"," self","-","esteem",","," which"," can"," in"," turn"," help"," them"," to"," better"," cope"," with"," the"," trauma"," of"," bullying"," or"," assault",".","\n\n","Another"," benefit"," of"," online"," learning"," for"," students"," who"," have"," experienced"," bullying"," or"," assault"," is"," the"," ability"," to"," connect"," with"," other"," students"," who"," have"," had"," similar"," experiences","."," Online"," learning"," platforms"," often"," have"," forums"," and"," discussion"," boards"," where"," students"," can"," connect"," with"," each"," other"," and"," share"," their"," experiences","."," This"," can"," provide"," a"," sense"," of"," community"," and"," support"," for"," students"," who"," may"," feel"," isolated"," and"," alone",".","\n\n","It","'","s"," also"," worth"," noting"," that"," online"," learning"," can"," provide"," a"," sense"," of"," anonymity"," for"," students"," who"," have"," been"," bullied"," or"," assaulted","."," In"," a"," traditional"," classroom",","," students"," are"," often"," easily"," identifiable",","," making"," them"," easy"," targets"," for"," bullies","."," However",","," in"," an"," online"," learning"," environment",","," students"," can"," choose"," to"," remain"," anonymous"," if"," they"," wish",","," which"," can"," help"," to"," protect"," their"," privacy"," and"," safety",".","\n\n","In"," addition"," to"," the"," benefits"," for"," individual"," students",","," online"," learning"," can"," also"," benefit"," schools"," as"," a"," whole","."," By"," providing"," an"," alternative"," learning"," option"," for"," sick",","," bullied",","," or"," assaulted"," students",","," schools"," can"," reduce"," absentee","ism"," and"," improve"," overall"," student"," engagement","."," This"," can"," lead"," to"," improved"," academic"," performance"," and"," a"," more"," positive"," school"," culture",".","\n\n","Of"," course",","," it","'","s"," important"," to"," note"," that"," online"," learning"," is"," not"," without"," its"," challenges","."," Students"," may"," struggle"," with"," motivation",","," time"," management",","," and"," technical"," issues","."," However",","," with"," the"," right"," support"," and"," resources",","," these"," challenges"," can"," be"," overcome",".","\n\n","In"," conclusion",","," online"," learning"," can"," provide"," significant"," benefits"," for"," students"," who"," are"," sick"," or"," have"," experienced"," bullying"," or"," assault","."," By"," allowing"," sick"," students"," to"," continue"," their"," education"," from"," the"," comfort"," of"," their"," own"," homes",","," online"," learning"," can"," protect"," the"," health"," of"," the"," school"," community"," and"," allow"," sick"," students"," to"," rest"," and"," recover","."," For"," students"," who"," have"," experienced"," bullying"," or"," assault",","," online","
