to"," keep"," in"," mind"," that"," pest"," populations"," can"," also"," adapt"," to"," non","-","chemical"," methods"," of"," control","."," For"," example",","," the"," northern"," corn","

for"," resistant"," strains"," even"," after"," they"," are"," no"," longer"," being"," applied",".","\n"," In"," response"," to"," resistance",","," managers"," may"," increase"," pesticide"," quantities","/","frequency",","," which"," exacerb","ates"," the"," problem","."," In"," addition",","," some"," pesticides"," are"," toxic"," toward"," species"," that"," feed"," on"," or","

referred"," to"," as"," the"," pesticide"," trap",","," or"," a"," ,"," since"," farmers"," progressively"," pay"," more"," for"," less"," benefit",".","\n"," Insect"," predators"," and","
