{"text_id":169300,"tokens":["I","'","m"," actually"," in"," a"," research"," lab"," where"," we"," study"," the"," effects"," and"," causes"," of"," itch","."," It"," is"," a"," field"," that"," is"," not"," very"," well"," known"," and"," is"," currently"," under"," a"," lot"," of"," scrutiny","."," I"," think"," it","'","s"," an"," important"," field"," because"," people"," really"," don","'","t"," know"," much"," about"," it"," and"," it","'","s"," very"," poorly"," understood","."," I"," think"," there"," are"," a"," lot"," of"," things"," that"," could"," be"," changed",","," but"," we","'","re"," just"," not"," sure"," what"," they"," are","."," -"," Scratch","ing",","," it","'","s"," very"," common"," and"," you"," may"," think"," that"," it","'","s"," a"," very"," natural"," thing"," to"," do","."," In"," fact",","," scratching"," is"," one"," of"," the"," first"," things"," that"," babies"," learn"," to"," do","."," And"," when"," we"," look"," at"," the"," effects"," of"," scratching",","," we"," find"," that"," it"," has"," a"," big"," impact"," on"," your"," brain",","," your"," immune"," system"," and"," your"," health","."," So",","," let","'","s"," talk"," about"," the"," immune"," system","."," You"," might"," be"," scratching"," because"," you"," have"," a"," rash",","," or"," maybe"," you","'","re"," just"," doing"," it"," for"," no"," reason"," at"," all","."," And"," we"," know"," that"," when"," you"," scratch",","," you"," release"," a"," chemical"," called"," histamine",","," and"," histamine",","," it","'","s"," a"," kind"," of"," chemical"," messenger","."," And"," it"," causes"," inflammation",","," which"," means"," that"," your"," body"," produces"," more"," cells",","," more"," chemicals",","," and"," it"," causes"," your"," body"," to"," be"," inflamed","."," And"," that"," inflammation"," then"," causes"," your"," body"," to"," react"," in"," a"," number"," of"," different"," ways","."," Some"," of"," them"," are"," things"," that"," you"," might"," not"," be"," able"," to"," control",","," but"," some"," of"," them"," you"," can","."," So",","," let","'","s"," say"," you","'","re"," scratching"," because"," you"," have"," a"," rash","."," The"," first"," thing"," that"," you"," can"," do"," is"," just"," try"," to"," keep"," the"," rash"," still","."," That"," means"," don","'","t"," scratch"," it",","," because"," scratching"," it"," will"," make"," it"," worse","."," The"," second"," thing"," that"," you"," can"," do"," is"," to"," use"," a"," lotion"," that"," has"," anti","hist","amines"," in"," it",","," and"," anti","hist","amines"," are"," very"," common"," in"," over"," the"," counter"," medications","."," They"," help"," you"," stop"," scratching",","," but"," they"," also"," stop"," your"," body"," from"," releasing"," histamine","."," So",","," there"," are"," some"," very"," common"," things"," that"," you"," can"," do"," to"," help"," keep"," your"," immune"," system"," from"," getting"," inflamed"," and"," also"," to"," help"," keep"," your"," body"," from"," scratching","."," And"," when"," you"," scratch",","," you"," can"," also"," produce"," other"," chemicals"," that"," you"," might"," not"," be"," able"," to"," control","."," One"," of"," those"," chemicals"," is"," a"," hormone"," called"," cortisol",","," and"," cortisol"," is"," a"," very"," important"," hormone"," in"," the"," body",","," but"," it","'","s"," also"," an"," inflammatory"," hormone","."," And"," so",","," scratching"," can"," actually"," cause"," you"," to"," have"," inflammation"," in"," the"," body",","," which"," can"," lead"," to"," a"," whole"," series"," of"," health"," problems","."," So",","," let","'","s"," talk"," about"," some"," of"," the"," health"," problems"," that"," are"," caused"," by"," scratching","."," There","'","s"," some"," problems"," that"," you"," can","'","t"," control","."," One"," of"," them"," is"," when"," you"," scratch"," your"," eyes",","," and"," your"," eyes"," are"," inflamed",","," it"," can"," make"," it"," very"," hard"," to"," see","."," So",","," you"," could"," have"," blurry"," vision",","," and"," that"," can"," lead"," to"," vision"," problems","."," And"," there","'","s"," some"," things"," that"," you"," can"," control","."," You"," can"," control"," your"," body"," temperature",","," and"," when"," you","'","re"," scratching",","," you","'","re"," not"," going"," to"," keep"," your"," body"," temperature"," cool","."," So",","," you","'","re"," going"," to"," have"," inflammation"," in"," your"," body",","," which"," can"," lead"," to"," a"," lot"," of"," different"," problems","."," There"," are"," some"," problems"," that"," you"," can"," control","."," You"," can"," control"," the"," amount"," of"," histamine"," that"," you"," produce","."," So",","," there"," are"," things"," that"," you"," can"," do"," to"," help"," your"," body"," stop"," itching","."," For"," example",","," if"," you","'","re"," allergic"," to"," something",","," you"," can"," take"," an"," anti","hist","amine"," to"," help"," your"," body"," stop"," itching",".","
