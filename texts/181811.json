{"text_id":181811,"tokens":["Trade"," diversion"," is"," an"," economic"," term"," related"," to"," international"," economics"," in"," which"," trade"," is"," diverted"," from"," a"," more","

the"," more"," efficient"," producer"," with"," the"," agreement"," increases"," trade",".","\n\n","The"," terms"," were"," used"," by"," '","old","'"," Chicago"," School"," economist"," Jacob","

the"," same"," tariff"," to"," all"," nations",","," it"," will"," always"," import"," from"," the"," most"," efficient"," producer",","," since"," the"," more"," efficient"," nation"," will"," provide"," the"," goods"," at"," a"," lower"," price","."," With"," the"," establishment"," of"," a"," bilateral"," or"," regional"," free"," trade"," agreement",","," that"," may"," not"," be"," the"," case",".","\n","If"," the"," agreement"," is"," signed"," with"," a"," less","-","efficient"," nation",","," it"," may"," well"," be"," that"," their"," products"," become"," cheaper"," in"," the"," importing"," market"," than"," those"," from"," the"," more","-","efficient"," nation",","," since"," there"," are"," taxes"," for"," only"," one"," of"," them","."," Consequently",","," after"," the"," establishment"," of"," the"," agreement",","," the"," importing"," country"," would"," acquire"," products"," from"," a"," higher","-","cost"," producer",","," instead"," of"," the"," low","-","cost"," producer"," from"," which"," it"," was"," importing"," until"," then","."," In"," other"," words",","," this"," would"," cause"," a"," trade"," diversion",".","\n\n","Term","\n","The"," term"," was"," coined"," by"," Jacob"," V","iner"," in"," The"," Customs"," Union"," Issue"," in"," ","1","9","5","0","."," In"," its"," literal"," meaning"," the"," term"," was"," however"," incomplete",","," as"," it"," failed"," to"," capture"," all"," welfare"," effects"," of"," discriminatory"," tariff"," liberalization",","," and"," it"," was"," not"," useful"," when"," it"," came"," to"," non","-","tar","iff"," barriers","."," Econom","ists"," have"," however"," dealt"," with"," this"," incomp","le","teness"," in"," two"," ways","."," Either"," they"," stretched"," the"," original"," meaning"," to"," cover"," all"," welfare"," effects",","," or"," they"," introduced"," new"," terms"," like"," trade"," expansion"," or"," internal"," versus"," external"," trade"," creation",".","\n\n","V","iner","'","s"," article"," became"," and"," still"," is"," the"," foundation"," of"," the"," theory"," of"," international"," economic"," integration","."," It"," considered"," only"," two"," states"," comparing"," their"," trade"," flows"," with"," the"," rest"," of"," the"," world"," after"," they"," abolish"," customs"," tariffs"," on"," inner"," border"," of"," their"," union","."," Following"," the"," fact"," that"," economic"," unions"," most"," often"," include"," more"," than"," ","2"," states",","," attempts"," have"," been"," made"," to"," increase"," the"," number"," of"," the"," states"," (","3","+","world","),"," but"," not"," so"," successfully",","," as"," they"," did"," not"," have"," as"," clear"," conclusions"," as"," V","iner","'","s",".","\n\n","Opposite"," to"," economically"," efficient"," trade"," creation"," effect",","," the"," trade"," diversion"," flow"," is"," cost","-","ine","fficient"," compared"," with"," the"," rest"," of"," the"," world","."," Balance"," between"," trade"," creation"," and"," trade"," diversion"," effects"," due"," to"," the"," creation"," of"," economic"," union"," makes"," the"," union"," either"," economically"," efficient"," (","positive"," balance",")"," or"," inefficient"," (","negative"," balance",")."," It"," is"," based"," on"," the"," fact"," that"," unification"," of"," states"," usually"," applies"," mergers"," of"," more"," than"," ","1"," sector"," in"," economy"," (","even"," European"," Coal"," and"," Steel"," Union",","," which"," had"," ","2"," sectors"," only",")"," leading"," to"," the"," creation"," of"," either"," trade"," creation"," or"," diversion"," effects",".","\n\n","Positive"," effects"," of"," trade"," diversion"," include"," increase"," of"," trade"," between"," unified"," states",","," increase"," of"," employment"," in"," manufacturing"," states"," inside"," the","
