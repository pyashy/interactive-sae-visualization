allowed"," only"," one"," document"," to"," be"," opened"," at"," once",","," Mind","Write"," allowed"," four"," to"," be"," opened"," in"," separate"," windows"," and"," text"," could"," be"," easily"," cut"," and"," pasted"," between"," them","."," It"," supported"," much"," larger"," documents",","," which"," would"," have"," to"," be"," broken"," up"," into"," parts"," in"," Mac","Write","."," It"," allowed"," a"," new"," layout"," ruler"," to"," be"," inserted"," at"," any"," point",","," easing"," layout"," changes","."," It"," also"," allowed"," editing"," with"," both"," the"," mouse"," and"," cursor"," keys",","," although"," it"," did"," not"," allow"," text"," selection"," using"," the"," keyboard",","," only"," movement","."," Some"," of"," the"," more"," advanced"," features"," included"," a"," word"," count",","," and"," the"," ability"," to"," mark"," sections"," as"," being"," changed",".","\n\n","The"," most"," notable"," feature",","," however",","," is"," the"," out","liner"," system","."," The"," document"," could"," be"," marked"," up"," with"," section"," separators",","," which"," defined"," the"," levels","."," A"," user","-","selected"," marker",","," normally"," a"," diamond",","," appears"," beside"," paragraphs","."," Additional"," text"," is"," normally"," added"," at"," the"," same"," level"," but"," can"," be"," dragged"," to"," become"," a"," sub","-","level"," using"," the"," mouse","."," Sections"," can"," be"," collapsed"," or"," expanded"," by"," clicking"," on"," their"," marker"," and"," can"," be"," displayed"," as"," empty"," or"," with"," the"," first"," line"," of"," text"," when"," in"," the"," collapsed"," state","."," When"," the"," user"," moves"," the"," mouse"," over"," one"," of"," the"," section"," markers"," the"," pointer"," turns"," into"," a"," hand",","," and"," holding"," down"," the"," mouse"," button"," shows"," it"," being"," \"","pin","ched","\""," and","
