{"text_id":63637,"tokens":["Well",","," I"," think"," it","'","s"," best"," to"," split"," this"," answer"," into"," two"," parts",","," the"," simple"," part"," and"," the"," complicated"," part",".","\n\n","The"," simple"," part"," is"," this",":"," a"," mutual"," fund"," is"," a"," type"," of"," **","investment"," fund","**.","  ","An"," investment"," fund"," is"," an"," instrument"," where"," a"," group"," of"," people"," pool"," their"," money"," together"," in"," order"," to"," construct"," an"," investment"," portfolio",".","\n\n","The"," reason"," why"," investment"," funds"," are"," common"," is"," that"," for"," regular"," folks"," who"," don","'","t"," have"," millions"," of"," dollars",","," it","'","s"," difficult"," to"," invest"," in"," a"," diverse"," set"," of"," assets"," at"," a"," reasonable"," price",":","\n\n","*"," If"," you"," invest"," all"," your"," money"," in"," just"," a"," few"," stocks",","," you"," run"," the"," risk"," that"," one"," of"," them"," will"," do"," very"," poorly"," and"," lose"," you"," a"," lot"," of"," money",".","  ","So"," it","'","s"," better"," to"," invest"," in"," a"," large"," number"," of"," different"," ones",";"," then"," if"," one"," bombs"," individually"," it","'","s"," less"," of"," a"," problem",".","\n","*"," But"," buying"," and"," selling"," stocks"," requires"," you"," to"," pay"," transaction"," fees",".","  ","And"," buying"," small"," amounts"," of"," a"," large"," number"," of"," different"," stocks"," means"," that"," you"," end"," up"," paying"," a"," lot"," in"," fees",".","\n\n","So"," an"," investment"," fund"," that"," pools"," money"," from"," thousands"," of"," different"," persons"," can"," easily"," buy"," a"," huge"," variety"," of"," stocks"," without"," spending"," too"," much"," money",".","\n\n","That"," was"," the"," simple"," part",".","  ","The"," complicated"," part"," is"," the"," details",".","  ","A"," *","mutual","*"," fund"," is"," one"," type"," of"," fund"," that","'","s"," defined"," by"," American"," law",".","  ","There"," are"," also"," other"," types"," of"," fund"," other"," than"," mutual"," funds",","," like"," *","exchange"," traded"," funds","*"," (\"","ET","Fs","\")"," and"," *","hedge"," funds","*.","  ","The"," rules"," for"," mutual"," funds"," are"," very"," tight",","," because"," they","'","re"," designed"," for"," everyday"," people"," to"," invest"," in",".","  ","(","Hedge"," funds"," have"," looser"," rules",","," but"," they","'","re"," not"," allowed"," to"," take"," money"," from"," average"," Jo","es",".)","  ","So"," there"," are"," rules"," for"," various"," purposes",","," for"," example",":","\n\n","*"," Protecting"," the"," fund","'","s"," investors"," from"," having"," their"," money"," stolen"," by"," the"," fund"," management",";","\n","*"," Requ","iring"," that"," the"," fund","'","s"," manager"," report"," the"," fund","'","s"," finances"," to"," the"," investors",";","\n","*"," Rest","rict","ing"," how"," the"," fund","'","s"," sponsor"," company"," may"," advertise"," them",".","\n\n","If"," you","'","re"," just"," getting"," started"," in"," this",","," I","'","d"," make"," a"," few"," recommendations",".","  ","First",","," nearly"," all"," mutual"," funds"," like"," to"," advertise"," their"," *","returns","*","\u2014","the"," amount"," of"," money"," an"," investor"," would"," have"," made"," if"," they","'","d"," put"," their"," money"," in"," for"," the"," last"," ","1",","," ","3",","," ","5"," or"," ","1","0"," years",".","  ","But"," those"," numbers"," can"," be"," misleading",".","  ","I","'","m"," not"," saying"," they","'","re"," *","in","accurate","*"," or"," *","lies","*","\u2014","just"," that"," they","'","re"," not"," nearly"," as"," significant"," as"," new"," or"," na\u00efve"," clients"," think"," they"," are",".","  ","\n\n","For"," example",","," a"," fund"," that"," invests"," in"," bonds"," will"," generally"," have"," lower"," numbers"," than"," one"," that"," invests"," in"," stocks",","," because"," bonds"," are"," generally"," safer"," than"," stocks",".","  ","So"," that"," doesn","'","t"," make"," the"," stock"," fund"," with"," the"," big"," numbers"," \"","better","\"\u2014","you"," can","'","t"," compare"," them"," that"," way","!","\n\n","Second",","," mutual"," fund"," managers"," get"," paid"," in"," an"," \"","invisible","\""," way"," that"," most"," of"," their"," clients"," don","'","t"," realize",".","  ","Basically",","," when"," you"," invest"," in"," a"," mutual"," fund"," you"," never"," get"," billed"," for"," it","\u2014","but"," the"," management"," is"," taking"," some"," of"," the"," money"," that"," you"," put"," in"," to"," pay"," themselves",".","  ","This"," is"," called"," the"," **","expense"," ratio","**"," of"," the"," fund","\u2014","the"," percentage"," that"," the"," managers"," take"," each"," year"," to"," pay"," themselves",".","  ","All"," funds"," report"," this"," number"," (","it","'","s"," required"," by"," law",")"," but"," most"," avoid"," putting"," it"," in"," the"," first"," page"," of"," the"," fund","'","s"," reports",".","  ","Always"," look"," at"," that"," number",".","\n\n","Third",","," and"," finally",","," what"," many"," people"," recommend"," as"," a"," very"," simple"," but"," good"," mutual"," fund"," is"," an"," all","-","in","-","one"," \"","target"," date","\""," index","-","based"," fund",","," like"," the"," [","Vanguard"," Target"," Retirement"," Funds","]","(_","URL","_","0","_",").","  ","These"," funds"," do"," three"," things",":","\n\n","1","."," They","'","re"," *","index"," funds","*:"," instead"," of"," trying"," to"," guess"," which"," investments"," are"," going"," to"," do"," best",","," they"," just"," put"," your"," money"," into"," the"," broadest"," set"," of"," investments"," possible",".","  ","This"," is"," a"," safer"," strategy"," that"," also"," leads"," to"," lower"," costs"," for"," the"," investors",".","\n","2","."," They","'","re"," *","all","-","in","-","one"," funds","*:"," they"," invest"," in"," a"," global"," mix"," of"," stocks"," and"," bonds",".","\n","3","."," They"," manage"," the"," portfolio","'","s"," risk"," based"," on"," your"," approximate"," age",".","  ","As"," you"," grow"," older"," and"," closer"," to"," retirement",","," the"," fund"," managers"," gradually"," move"," the"," portfolio"," from"," risk","ier"," investments"," to"," safer"," ones","."],"sub_source":"reddit","model":"human","label":0}
