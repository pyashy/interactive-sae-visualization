when"," they"," were"," controlled"," by"," previous"," governments","."," If"," you","'","re"," talking"," about"," the"," modern"," political"," units",","," the"," number"," is"," much"," much","

they"," did"," (","so"," for"," luxem","bourg",","," it"," was"," american"," troops"," who"," invaded"," them"," in"," ww","2"," but"," possibly"," some"," british"," troops"," accidentally","
