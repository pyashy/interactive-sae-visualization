{"text_id":147762,"tokens":["The"," United"," States","'"," Electoral"," College"," is"," a"," vesti","ge"," of"," the"," ","1","8","th"," century"," that"," continues"," to"," dictate"," the","

Electoral"," votes"," are"," allocated"," to"," states"," partly"," based"," on"," their"," representation"," in"," Congress",","," which",","," due"," to"," the"," minimum"," allocation"," of"," three"," electoral"," votes"," per"," state",","," ske","ws"," power"," in"," favor"," of"," less"," populous"," states","."," Consequently",","," a"," vote"," cast"," in"," Wyoming"," carries","

system"," already"," marginal","izes"," voters"," in"," '","safe","'"," states",","," both"," large"," and"," small","."," A"," popular"," vote"," would"," compel"," candidates"," to"," appeal"," to"," voters"," across"," the"," board",","," thus"," promoting"," policies"," that"," address"," the"," concerns"," of"," the"," entire"," population",".","\n","Implementing"," a"," popular","
