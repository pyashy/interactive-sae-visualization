the"," imagination"," of"," the"," public"," quite"," like"," the"," so","-","called"," \"","Face"," on"," Mars",".\""," Discovered"," in"," a"," photograph"," taken"," by"," the"," Viking"," ","1"," orb","iter"," in"," ","1","9","7","6",","," the"," image"," appeared"," to"," show"," a"," humanoid"," face"," on"," the"," Martian"," surface",","," leading"," to"," widespread"," speculation","

the"," photographs",","," NASA"," scientists"," noticed"," a"," peculiar",","," face","-","like"," structure"," in"," the"," C","yd","onia"," region","."," The"," low"," resolution"," of"," these"," early"," images",","," coupled"," with"," human"," tendencies"," to"," recognize"," familiar"," patterns"," (","pare","ido","lia","),"," contributed"," to"," the"," widespread"," belief"," that"," the"," feature"," was"," artificial",".","\n\n","However",","," the"," Mars"," Global"," Surveyor"," (","M","GS",")"," mission",","," launched"," in"," ","1","9","9","6",","," provided"," a"," more","

again"," in"," ","2","0","0","1","."," These"," images"," revealed"," that"," the"," face","-","like"," appearance"," was"," merely"," an"," optical"," illusion"," caused"," by"," interplay"," of","

to"," those"," found"," in"," many"," desert"," regions"," on"," Earth",".","\n\n","####"," Sim","ilarities"," with"," Earth","ly"," Land","forms","\n\n","Ge","ologists"," quickly"," pointed"," out"," that"," the"," Martian"," land","form"," bore"," striking"," resemb","lances"," to"," naturally"," occurring"," mesas"," on"," Earth","."," These"," flat","-","topped"," hills",","," formed","

that"," the"," Face"," on"," Mars"," is"," a"," natural"," formation",".","\n\n","####"," Influence"," of"," Media"," on"," Public"," Perception","\n\n","The"," initial"," excitement"," surrounding"," the"," Face"," on"," Mars"," was"," largely"," fueled"," by"," media"," coverage","."," Sens","ational"," headlines"," and"," speculative"," documentaries"," capitalized"," on"," the","

of"," why"," it"," is"," crucial"," to"," base"," our"," understanding"," on"," empirical"," evidence"," and"," scientific"," inquiry","."," Mis","interpret","ations"," driven"," by","
