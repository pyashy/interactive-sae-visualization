{"text_id":214876,"tokens":["How"," to"," Converse"," and"," Rel","ate"," to"," British"," People","'","\n","Con","versing"," and"," relating"," to"," British"," people"," can"," often"," be"," quite"," daunting"," for"," someone"," more"," accustomed"," to"," American"," English"," -"," as"," the"," two"," countries"," are"," vastly"," different"," in"," terms"," of"," culture"," and"," even"," language","."," However",","," understanding"," and"," engaging"," \u2018","properly","\u2019"," with"," British"," people"," is"," not"," as"," hard"," as"," it"," first"," seems","."," In"," order"," to"," get"," conversational"," and"," relational"," fluency"," with"," the"," British",","," there"," are"," a"," few"," simple"," steps"," you"," can"," take",".","\n","First"," and"," foremost",","," it"," is"," important"," to"," remember"," that"," assuming"," every"," British"," person"," will"," have"," an"," interest"," in"," art"," or"," a"," \u2018","kn","ack","\u2019"," for"," conversation"," is"," setting"," yourself"," up"," for"," disappointment","."," Just"," like"," in"," America"," \u2013"," and"," most"," countries"," for"," that"," matter"," \u2013"," people"," will"," have"," vastly"," different"," interests",","," views",","," and"," personalities","."," Therefore",","," it"," is"," essential"," to"," keep"," an"," open","-","mind"," and"," not"," just"," expect"," stereotyp","ically"," British"," topics"," of"," conversation"," to"," occur"," all"," the"," time",".","\n","Second",","," it"," is"," useful"," to"," remember"," that"," football"," (","soccer",")"," will"," almost"," always"," be"," a"," topic"," of"," conversation"," when"," engaging"," with"," British"," people","."," While"," familiar","ising"," yourself"," with"," the"," rules"," and"," regulations"," of"," the"," game"," is"," not"," essential",","," it"," is"," beneficial"," to"," understand"," the"," basics"," and"," being"," able"," to"," follow"," the"," general"," conversations"," about"," the"," sport","."," No"," matter"," what"," your"," interests"," or"," hobbies"," might"," be",","," understanding"," some"," of"," the"," most"," popular"," and"," commonly"," talked"," about"," subject"," in"," Britain"," (","almost"," akin"," to"," speaking"," about"," baseball"," in"," America",")"," will"," prove"," beneficial"," in"," aiding"," conversations"," and"," forging"," relationships"," with"," the"," natives",".","\n","Third","ly",","," words"," and"," terminology"," differ"," from"," the"," United"," Kingdom"," (","UK",")"," to"," the"," United"," States"," of"," America"," (","USA",")."," While"," American"," English"," may"," be"," an"," official"," language"," in"," certain"," countries",","," it"," is"," an"," unofficial"," one"," in"," Britain","."," Thus",","," while"," words"," likes"," \u2018","candy","\u2019"," and"," \u2018","J","ello","\u2019"," are"," commonplace"," in"," the"," USA",","," they"," are"," not"," in"," the"," UK",";"," therefore",","," learning"," what"," the"," alternative"," words"," are"," (\u2018","s","weets","\u2019"," and"," \u2018","jelly","\u2019)"," is"," essential","."," On"," a"," similar"," note",","," tea",","," scones",","," and"," fry","-","ups"," may"," commonly"," come"," up"," in"," conversation"," but"," it"," is"," important"," to"," remember"," that"," such"," things"," are"," not"," always"," on"," the"," top"," of"," the"," list"," for"," British"," people"," when"," discussing"," food",".","\n","Moreover",","," if"," you"," are"," able"," to"," cook"," a"," dish"," from"," a"," foreign"," cuisines"," as"," well"," as"," British"," cuisine",","," then"," you"," will"," certainly"," be"," on"," the"," right"," track"," when"," conversing"," with"," British"," people","."," This"," is"," because",","," as"," popular"," Channel"," ","4"," show"," \u2018","Come"," Dine"," With"," Me","\u2019"," has"," made"," clearly"," demonstrated",","," the"," complexity"," and"," ability"," of"," one","\u2019","s"," cooking"," is"," judged"," with"," each"," passing"," course","."," Thus",","," if"," you"," can"," whip"," up"," a"," plethora"," of"," dishes"," from"," various"," different"," cuisines",","," you"," may"," find"," that"," you"," have"," made"," a"," favourable"," impression"," amongst"," the"," Brits"," and"," have"," given"," them"," something"," new"," and"," different"," to"," talk"," about",".","\n","In"," addition",","," the"," British"," pride"," themselves"," in"," their"," rich"," and"," extensive"," history"," \u2013"," which"," includes",","," but"," is"," not"," exclusive"," to",","," the"," Monarchy","."," Knowing"," a"," few"," of"," the"," key"," figures"," and"," different"," timeline"," elements"," of"," the"," Monarchy"," can"," prove"," helpful"," when"," engaging"," with"," British"," people","."," Even"," if"," you"," are"," not"," familiar"," with"," all"," the"," details",","," having"," a"," basic"," knowledge"," \u2013"," such"," as"," the"," order"," of"," the"," current"," King"," and"," Queen"," -"," could"," be"," beneficial"," when"," it"," comes"," to"," conversing"," and"," relating"," to"," British"," people",".","\n","Furthermore",","," do"," not"," forget"," to"," begin"," a"," conversation"," by"," complaining"," about"," the"," weather"," (","even"," though"," you"," may"," be"," a"," fan"," of"," it",")."," This"," is"," because"," to"," the"," British",","," all"," weather"," is"," either"," too"," hot"," or"," too"," cold"," \u2013"," at"," least"," according"," to"," the"," general"," opinion","."," This"," is"," a"," go"," to"," conversation"," starter"," and"," one"," of"," the"," biggest"," cultural"," differences"," between"," British"," and"," American"," people",","," so"," if"," you"," can"," come"," to"," terms"," with"," this"," phenomenon"," you"," have"," more"," than"," likely"," established"," yourself"," as"," familiar"," with"," some"," of"," the"," more"," \u2018","British","\u2019"," aspects"," of"," British"," culture",".","\n","Equ","ally",","," although"," many"," British"," people"," still"," live"," in"," ","1","9","th"," century"," housing",","," this"," is"," not"," the"," norm"," and"," it"," is"," important"," to"," remember"," that","."," That"," being"," said",","," these"," housing"," areas"," are"," often"," full"," of"," character"," and"," can"," be"," a"," talking"," point"," when"," engaging"," with"," the"," locals",".","\n","Also",","," do"," not"," forget"," that"," some"," British"," people"," love"," Americans","!"," This"," is"," often"," overlooked"," when"," someone"," is"," trying"," to"," forge"," a"," relationship"," with"," a"," British"," person"," as"," many"," people"," feel"," as"," if"," they"," have"," to"," apologise"," for"," being"," American","."," Although"," cultural"," knowledge"," may"," be"," a"," help",","," you"," do"," not"," need"," to"," sell"," yourself"," short"," \u2013"," show"," off"," your"," cultural"," knowledge"," if"," you"," wish",","," but"," do"," not"," feel"," ashamed"," about"," being"," an"," American",".","\n","Finally",","," education"," systems"," differ"," in"," the"," USA"," and"," the"," UK",";"," for"," example",","," in"," the"," UK",","," it"," is"," common"," to"," be"," enrolled"," in"," Pre","-","School",","," Primary",","," Junior",","," Secondary"," and"," Sixth"," Form",","," whereas"," in"," America",","," Pre","-","School",","," Elementary",","," Middle"," and"," High"," School"," are"," the"," typical"," education"," sectors","."," Understanding"," the"," different"," systems"," will"," help"," to","

yourself","."," Whether"," you"," are"," American",","," British"," or"," from"," anywhere"," else"," in"," the"," world",","," your"," culture"," and"," nationality"," should"," be"," celebrated","
