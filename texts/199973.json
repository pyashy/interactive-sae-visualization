{"text_id":199973,"tokens":["BS","ky","B"," has"," no"," veto"," over"," the"," presence"," of"," channels"," on"," their"," E","PG",","," with"," open"," access"," being"," an"," enforced"," part","

channels"," which"," are"," on"," Sky","'","s"," E","PG"," are"," normally"," sold"," to"," Sky"," by"," independent"," distributors"," who"," can"," negotiate"," their"," own"," terms","."," Sky"," has"," no"," control"," over"," this","."," In"," the"," case"," of"," Sky"," Movies",","," its"," true"," that"," Sky"," uses"," the"," term"," '","Broadcast"," Rights","'"," to"," describe"," their"," deal"," with"," the"," distributor","."," However",","," the"," term"," is"," not"," used"," in"," the"," way"," you"," suggest","."," For"," example",","," Sky"," does"," not"," have"," the"," right"," to"," re","-","broadcast"," the"," channel"," on"," their"," own"," channel"," number","."," This"," would"," be"," an"," exclusive"," '","Broadcast"," Rights","'"," deal",","," and"," Sky"," simply"," don","'","t"," do"," this"," kind"," of"," thing"," with"," any"," of"," their"," channels","."," What"," Sky"," does"," have"," is"," a"," non","-","exclusive"," right"," to"," re","-","broadcast"," the"," channel"," on"," the"," Sky"," E","PG",","," but"," only"," for"," the"," length"," of"," time"," that"," the"," distributor"," has"," a"," valid"," E","PG"," entry"," for"," the"," channel","."," So",","," if"," the"," distributor"," withdraws"," the"," channel",","," Sky"," will"," remove"," it"," from"," the"," E","PG"," at"," the"," same"," time","."," Sky","'","s"," ability"," to"," have"," a"," valid"," E","PG"," entry"," for"," the"," channel"," comes"," from"," the"," fact"," that"," the"," distributor"," has"," done"," a"," deal"," with"," an"," independent"," company"," which"," has"," an"," existing"," E","PG"," entry",","," which"," gives"," Sky"," the"," right"," to"," carry"," the"," channel","."," In"," this"," way",","," Sky"," has"," no"," rights"," to"," the"," channel"," in"," any"," way"," other"," than"," to"," use"," it"," on"," the"," E","PG","."," The"," full"," detail"," of"," the"," agreement"," is"," not","

The"," channel"," itself"," is"," normally"," owned"," by"," an"," independent"," company",","," but"," the"," distributor"," will"," have"," a"," contract"," to"," deliver"," the"," channel"," to"," Sky"," in"," exchange"," for"," payment","."," Sky","'","s"," E","PG"," entry"," is"," an"," additional"," clause"," in"," this"," contract","."," So",","," Sky"," is"," not"," in"," control"," of"," the"," channel",","," it"," merely"," has"," the"," right"," to"," re","-","broadcast"," it"," on"," the"," E","PG"," in"," exchange"," for"," payment","."," Sky","'","s"," E","PG"," is"," a"," public"," service",","," and"," any"," channel"," which"," wants"," to"," be"," on"," it"," needs"," to"," be"," able"," to"," get"," there","."," Sky"," has"," no"," veto"," over"," which"," channels"," go"," on"," it","."," It","'","s"," likely"," that"," Sky","'","s"," E","PG"," entry"," merely"," refers"," to"," the"," rights"," it"," has"," to"," use"," the"," channel",","," and"," nothing"," more","."," The"," above"," is"," just"," my"," speculation",","," but"," I"," don","'","t"," think"," that"," Sky"," is"," in"," any"," way"," over","st","ating"," the"," situation","."," Incidentally",","," you"," may"," also"," notice"," that"," BBC"," Entertainment"," is"," listed"," as"," '","BBC","2","',"," which"," is"," because"," the"," channel","'","s"," E","PG"," entry"," was"," put"," through"," before"," the"," BBC"," renamed"," it"," to"," '","BBC"," Entertainment","'."," You"," can"," confirm"," all"," this"," by"," looking"," at"," the"," regulations"," which","

I"," had"," a"," Sky"," HD"," box"," installed"," a"," few"," months"," ago","."," When"," I"," called"," to"," sort"," out"," a"," TV"," licence"," for"," the"," new"," HD"," box",","," I"," was","

and"," that"," I"," would"," have"," to"," pay"," for"," one","."," I"," was"," also"," told"," that"," there"," was"," no"," way"," of"," getting"," Sky"," TV"," without"," a"," TV"," licence",".","
