{"text_id":179005,"tokens":["One"," of"," the"," most"," direct"," ways"," you"," can"," build"," up"," your"," characters"," is"," to"," develop"," their"," physical"," tags"," or"," markers",","," such"," as"," how"," they"," look","."," Creating"," specific"," and"," distinct"," images"," of"," your"," characters"," can"," help"," the"," reader"," get"," a"," better"," sense"," of"," how"," they"," appear"," to"," themselves"," and"," to"," others",".","For"," example",","," in"," the"," Harry"," Potter"," book"," series",","," the"," character"," Hermione"," Granger"," is"," described"," as"," having"," buck"," teeth"," and"," bushy"," hair","."," This"," indicates"," to"," the"," reader"," that"," perhaps"," she"," is"," not"," a"," well"," put"," together"," person"," or"," could"," come"," across"," as"," a"," nerd","."," This"," is"," in"," contrast"," to"," another"," character"," in"," the"," series",","," Minerva"," McG","on","ag","all",","," who"," is"," described"," as"," having"," square"," shaped"," spectacles"," and"," always"," wears"," her"," hair"," in"," a"," tight"," bun","."," Minerva"," then"," comes"," across"," as"," more"," put","

character",","," an"," unique"," physical"," marker"," or"," trait","."," This"," can"," help"," the"," reader"," to"," remember"," the"," character"," better"," and"," also"," tell"," the","

to"," the"," reader",".","You"," could"," give"," your"," character"," a"," physical"," mark"," like"," a"," scar",","," a"," tattoo",","," an"," item"," of"," clothing"," that"," they"," never","

a"," missing"," sense"," (","such"," as"," blindness"," or"," deafness","),"," or"," a"," positive"," physical"," trait",","," like"," beautiful"," hair"," or"," clear"," skin",".","\n","For","

of"," clothing"," she"," is"," supposed"," to"," wear",","," such"," as"," a"," school"," uniform"," or"," a"," work"," uniform","."," Focus"," on"," concrete"," details"," of"," her","
