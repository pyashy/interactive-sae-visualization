of"," Illinois",","," students"," in"," traditional"," classroom"," settings"," scored"," higher"," on"," comprehension"," tests"," compared"," to"," those"," who"," learned"," remotely","."," This"," is"," largely"," attributed"," to"," the"," structured"," nature"," of"," school"," environments"," that"," encourage"," active"," listening"," and"," participation",".","\n\n","Moreover",","," the"," spontaneous"," interactions"," that"," occur"," during"," in","-","person"," classes",","," such"," as"," group"," discussions"," and"," peer","-","to","-","peer"," explanations",","," can"," greatly"," enhance"," understanding","."," These"," interactions"," are"," harder"," to"," replicate"," in"," an"," online"," setting",","," where"," limited"," bandwidth"," and"," technological","
