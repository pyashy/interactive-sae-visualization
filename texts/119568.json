going"," up"," until"," his"," father","'","s"," office"," was"," in"," view"," then"," turned"," around"," and"," walked"," back"," toward"," me"," like"," nothing"," had"," happened","."," He"," grabbed"," my"," hand"," as"," we"," got"," closer"," and"," pulled"," me"," into"," a"," hug"," that"," made"," me"," want"," to"," cry"," for"," him"," instead"," of"," anger"," at"," him"," for"," what"," he","'","d"," done"," when"," I"," wanted"," him"," to"," love"," me"," more"," than"," anything"," else"," on"," this"," earth","."," For"," the"," first"," time"," all"," night"," I"," felt"," safe"," enough"," with"," him"," not"," because"," of"," our"," past"," but"," just"," because"," I"," knew"," he"," really"," genuinely"," cared"," about"," me"," even"," though"," I"," wasn","'","t"," sure"," how"," much"," he"," actually"," did"," anymore"," after"," everything"," he"," put"," me"," through"," lately","."," All"," the"," pain"," from"," the"," last"," few","

about"," letting"," myself"," feel"," it"," again"," or"," touching"," him"," in"," any"," way"," other"," than"," walking"," away"," from"," him","."," I"," hate"," how"," much"," I"," miss"," him"," sometimes","."," That"," feeling"," of"," being"," loved"," is"," nearly"," impossible"," right"," now"," thanks"," to"," Adam","'","s"," actions"," tonight"," which"," only"," solidified"," exactly"," why"," I"," needed"," to"," leave"," while"," there"," still"," was"," time"," to"," escape"," before"," he"," found"," some"," way"," to"," convince"," himself"," otherwise","."," Even"," if"," he"," couldn","'","t"," control"," himself"," around"," me"," the"," second"," he"," stepped"," foot"," inside"," my"," apartment"," building",","," he"," would"," be"," able"," to"," stay","

desperately"," to"," find"," some"," kind"," of"," clue"," that"," might"," reveal"," my"," next"," step"," regarding"," him","."," I"," finally"," reached"," behind"," the"," sofa"," and"," felt"," along"," the"," wall"," between"," cushions"," before"," finding"," a"," hidden"," book"," shelf"," containing"," old"," journals"," and"," notebooks"," belonging"," to"," both"," my"," mother"," and"," grandmother"," written"," in"," their"," native"," languages"," namely"," French"," and"," German"," respectively","."," I"," flipped"," through"," to"," the"," very"," end"," of"," each","

offer"," was"," genuine"," or"," whether"," he"," was"," playing"," games"," yet"," again","."," My"," eyes"," fell"," upon"," a"," handwritten"," note"," I"," hadn","'","t"," seen"," before"," sitting"," atop"," two"," folded"," sheets"," of"," yellow"," legal"," pad"," paper"," marked"," CASH"," ONLY","."," Without"," hesitation"," I"," ripped"," off"," the"," top"," sheet"," revealing"," something"," wrapped"," carefully"," within"," a"," cello","phane"," wrapper"," underneath","."," It"," took"," less"," than"," five"," minutes"," to"," extract"," it"," from"," its"," protective"," packaging"," and"," unfold"," it"," showing"," the"," most"," breathtaking"," picture"," I","'","ve"," ever"," seen","."," A"," young"," girl"," with"," blonde"," hair"," dressed"," in"," typical"," business"," attire"," posing"," wearing"," a"," pair"," of"," black"," boots"," and"," carrying"," a"," briefcase"," stood"," outside"," her"," room"," with"," a"," man"," who"," looked"," older"," than"," she"," was"," holding"," hands"," tightly"," with"," someone"," even"," younger"," and"," appearing"," too"," young"," to"," take"," care"," of"," herself","."," They"," appeared"," to"," be"," making"," out"," although"," the"," boy"," looked"," completely"," un","interested","."," His"," face"," was"," obscured"," by"," a"," scarf"," wrapped"," around"," his"," head"," covering"," his"," face"," below"," his"," chin"," allowing"," me"," to"," see"," sharp"," features"," such"," as"," deep"," red"," lips"," and"," bright"," brown"," eyes"," underneath","."," F","rowning"," slightly"," at"," the"," image"," as"," well"," as"," realizing"," it"," must"," belong"," to"," Adam"," if"," he"," wrote"," it",","," I"," quickly"," placed"," it"," back"," in"," place"," and","

enjoyed"," doing"," and"," likely"," never"," will"," but"," it"," seemed"," necessary"," nonetheless","."," I"," studied"," the"," photos"," closely"," taking"," pictures"," of"," each"," to","

obviously"," unknown"," since"," you"," don","'","t"," typically"," write"," things"," clearly"," visible"," in"," photographs"," including"," names",","," ages",","," genders"," and"," whereabouts"," based"," solely"," on"," resemblance"," plus"," the"," fact"," that"," our"," situation"," isn","'","t"," entirely"," unlike"," many"," others","."," When"," I"," finished"," writing"," everything","
