The"," Vampire",":"," A"," Folk"," Tale"," by"," Bron"," Taylor"," was"," my"," gateway"," into"," learning"," more"," about"," Vamp","ires"," because"," I"," didn","'","t"," really"," know"," much"," about"," them"," before"," reading"," that"," book"," (","and"," still"," don","'","t",")."," This"," one"," has"," been"," sitting"," on"," my"," bookshelf"," for"," quite"," awhile"," now"," so"," I"," decided"," to"," finally"," read"," it"," over"," the"," weekend"," while"," watching"," some"," Netflix"," shows","!"," And"," let"," me"," just"," say","..."," I"," am"," obsessed","!!!"," The"," way"," they"," described"," vampires"," is"," spot","-","on",";"," yet"," at"," times"," felt"," like"," fairy"," tales"," or"," even"," legends","."," It"," made"," sense"," to"," me"," and"," struck"," such"," an"," amazing"," balance"," between"," what"," you"," would"," assume"," from"," common"," beliefs","concerns"," vs"," actual"," history"," behind"," vamp","ir","ism","."," For"," example"," -"," When"," the"," ancient"," Greeks"," thought"," that"," men"," were"," turning"," into"," wolves"," after"," being"," bitten"," by"," bats",","," etc",".."," They"," believed"," these"," were"," myths"," to"," scare"," children"," as"," well"," as"," provide"," caution","ary"," tales"," against"," people"," who"," drank"," blood"," excessively","."," But"," years"," later"," after"," researching"," many"," of"," their"," own"," traditions"," and"," cultures",","," they"," found"," how"," true"," those"," stories"," actually"," could"," have"," been"," instead","."," So"," although"," it"," may"," seem"," silly"," today"," that"," we"," live"," our"," lives"," (","whether"," believe"," or"," not",")"," based"," off"," \"","fairy"," tale","\""," lore"," myth","os"," -"," there"," is"," truth"," to"," every"," single"," story","."," Even"," ones"," that"," do"," appear"," strange"," then"," become"," somewhat"," understandable"," with"," time",".;",")"," Next"," thing"," I"," want"," to"," talk"," about"," is"," modern"," movie"," depictions"," versus"," real"," world"," historical"," accounts","."," One"," thing"," that"," always"," bothered"," me"," about"," movies"," dealing"," with"," these"," creatures"," of"," darkness","dem","ons"," going"," back"," to"," my"," days"," playing"," Dungeons"," Dragons"," growing"," up"," was"," how"," unrealistic"," they"," ended"," up"," seeming"," due"," to"," material"," limitations"," and"," lack"," of"," understanding"," technology","."," There"," isn","'","t"," anything"," wrong"," with"," this"," though"," but"," it"," kind"," of"," makes"," you"," wonder"," where"," else"," we"," will"," go"," with"," this"," whole"," mythology"," if"," someone"," decides"," to"," make"," another"," film"," series"," involving"," their"," existence","."," Sometimes"," Hollywood"," does"," it"," right","."," Like"," the"," Twilight"," Saga"," which"," was"," extremely"," realistic"," and","

generation","."," Not"," only"," will"," they"," help"," teach"," our"," younger"," generations"," correct"," information",","," but"," also"," themselves"," too","."," It","'","s"," important"," they"," feel"," empowered"," enough"," to"," express"," their"," opinions"," through"," art"," rather"," than"," hiding"," away"," afraid"," to"," tell"," anyone"," different"," than"," what"," they"," think","."," Movies"," give"," them"," a"," medium"," where"," everyone"," agrees"," with"," them"," and"," lets"," them"," safely"," explore"," whatever"," topics"," they"," might"," find","
