{"text_id":126105,"tokens":["First",","," I"," want"," to"," point"," out"," that"," neither"," being"," religious"," nor"," being"," Republican"," is"," a"," bad"," or"," negative"," thing","."," People"," are"," entitled"," to"," their"," own"," beliefs"," because"," this"," is"," America","."," A"," lot"," of"," small"," southern"," communities"," social"," circles"," revolve"," around"," church","-","life",","," especially"," in"," rural"," areas",","," causing"," traditional"," religion"," to"," be"," a"," large"," part"," of"," life","."," This"," creates"," a"," large"," social","-","conserv","atism"," base","."," Despite"," the"," general"," misconception"," being"," that"," the"," South"," is"," uneducated",","," there"," are"," several"," strong"," academic"," institutions"," around"," the"," region"," and"," not"," everyone"," is"," uneducated","."," With"," that"," said"," there"," is"," a"," strong"," streak"," of"," independence"," in"," Southern"," families"," and"," there"," is"," strong"," resistance"," to"," over","bearing"," government"," authority","."," In"," general"," Democrats"," push"," more"," for"," big"," government",","," and"," I"," think"," at"," the"," end"," of"," the"," day"," there"," is"," a"," general"," feeling"," that"," people"," should"," not"," be"," told"," what"," to"," do","."," Consider"," the"," development"," of"," the"," South",":"," almost"," primarily"," agrarian"," for"," the"," majority"," of"," its"," history","."," Huge"," states"," rights"," issue"," that"," resulted"," in"," being"," invaded"," by"," the"," Union"," and"," having"," a"," large"," part"," of"," the"," region"," (","and"," personal"," property",")"," burned","."," I"," think"," in"," general"," there"," is"," just"," general"," distrust"," of"," large"," government"," (","the"," exception"," being"," religious"," social"," conservatism"," that"," encourages"," government"," control"," of"," social"," lives",".)"," The"," younger"," population"," of"," the"," South"," is"," definitely"," ske","wing"," more"," toward"," Libert","arian","ism",","," once"," they"," learn"," what"," that"," term"," means","."," The"," common"," thread"," I","'","ve"," seen"," among"," is"," that"," many"," Republicans"," are"," Republican"," for"," financial"," conservatism"," reasons"," or"," military","defense"," reasons"," not"," religious"," reasons",".,","It"," stems"," from"," the"," days"," of"," colonialism",","," slave"," trade",","," European"," immigration",","," and"," Latino"," immigration","."," The"," thirteen"," original"," colonies"," were"," not"," homogeneous"," in"," demographics","."," While"," they"," were"," pretty"," much"," all"," white",","," they"," came"," from"," different"," cultures","."," They"," were"," all"," Christians",","," but"," they"," belonged"," to"," different"," denominations","."," Now"," here"," is"," where"," I"," simplify"," history"," and"," give"," it"," no"," justice",","," but"," it"," should"," be"," enough"," to"," understand"," current"," trends","."," The"," religious"," that"," settled"," in"," the"," north"," were"," very"," religious"," but"," also"," had"," an"," element"," of"," human","ism"," in"," their"," beliefs","."," There"," was"," an"," element"," of"," tolerance"," of"," others","."," The"," ones"," that"," settled"," in"," the"," south"," were"," more"," likely"," to"," believe"," in"," a"," stricter"," reading"," of"," the"," bible","."," They"," were"," less"," likely"," to"," tolerate"," any"," devi","ance"," from"," the"," norm","."," As"," the"," country"," grew"," and"," families"," began"," to"," move"," west",","," they"," took"," these"," religious"," up","bring","ings"," and"," influence","."," If"," you"," pay"," attention",","," you","'","ll"," notice"," that"," northern"," Mid","western"," states"," are"," conservative"," but"," not"," evange","lic","ally"," conservative","."," The"," evangelical"," conservatives"," are"," still"," there",","," but"," they"," don","'","t"," hold"," the"," same"," influence"," as"," the"," ones"," in"," southern"," states","."," Now"," that"," we","'","ve"," covered"," religious"," depth"," (","deep","ly"," conservative"," colonists"," immig","rated"," to"," the"," south"," and"," spread"," in"," that"," general"," direction","),"," lets"," move"," on"," to"," the"," Republican"," answer","."," Because"," the"," northern"," religious"," folk"," were"," a"," bit"," more"," tolerant"," of"," others",","," liberalism"," was"," able"," to"," take"," root","."," The"," southern"," religious"," folk"," were"," far"," more"," traditional"," and"," so"," didn","'","t"," really"," experiment"," with"," \"","progressive","\""," ideas"," as"," much","."," So"," now"," we"," have"," a"," culture"," of"," political"," conservatism"," in"," the"," south"," and"," a"," culture"," of"," political"," progres","si","vism"," in"," the"," north","."," Political"," progres","si","vism"," in"," the"," north"," was"," fueled"," by"," European"," immigration","."," While"," there"," was"," surely"," a"," lot"," of"," hate"," for"," these"," European"," minorities",","," it"," pushed"," others"," to"," lobby"," their"," politicians"," to"," do"," something"," about"," the"," problems"," that"," were"," brought"," in"," by"," European"," immigrants"," and"," the"," problems"," that"," these"," European"," immigrants"," were"," facing","."," So"," you"," kind"," of"," get"," this"," tendency"," that"," society"," should"," work"," together"," to"," solve"," some"," of"," society","'","s"," problems","."," Southern"," political"," conservatism"," was"," fueled"," by"," the"," slave"," trade","."," Blacks"," were"," already"," seen"," as"," sub","-","human","."," So"," there"," was"," this"," sentiment"," that"," made"," many"," sou","therners"," wonder"," why"," they"," should"," help"," these"," sub","-","humans"," when"," they"," were"," freed","."," Any"," attempt"," by"," the"," Nor","therners"," to"," help"," blacks"," through"," the"," federal","
