{"text_id":192603,"tokens":["I","'","m"," currently"," reading"," Anne"," Apple","baum","'","s"," book",","," Gu","lag",","," and"," she"," goes"," over"," many"," similar"," scenarios"," in"," it","."," In"," short"," you"," would"," be"," arrested",","," sent"," to"," a"," holding"," cell"," and"," interrogated",","," sent"," to"," trial",","," then"," sentenced"," to"," either"," a"," remote"," camp"," or"," prison","."," From"," there"," you"," would"," either"," die"," a"," slow"," death"," of"," disease"," and"," malnutrition"," or"," survive",".","\n","Up"," until"," ","1","9","3","9"," Russian"," secret"," police"," had"," immense"," pressure"," from"," the"," government",","," sometimes"," even"," Stalin",","," to"," not"," make"," mistakes","."," This"," often"," led"," to"," innocent"," people"," being"," arrested"," under"," mere"," speculation","."," There"," are"," even"," accounts"," of"," the"," NK","VD"," admitting"," they"," arrested"," innocent"," people"," but"," were"," not"," allowed"," to"," free"," them","."," If"," you"," were"," actually"," found"," with"," contraband"," it"," was"," a"," guarantee"," that"," you"," would"," be"," arrested","."," In"," your"," scenario"," it"," sounds"," as"," though"," the"," NK","VD"," were"," already"," in"," your"," home"," prior"," to"," finding"," the"," literature","."," Since"," they"," were"," already"," present"," it"," would"," be"," assumed"," they"," were"," there"," to"," arrest"," you"," anyway","."," Following"," your"," arrest"," you"," would"," be"," transported"," to"," a"," temporary"," holding"," cell"," and"," interrogated","."," Since"," they"," had"," hard"," evidence"," against"," you"," the"," interrogation"," process"," may"," be"," skipped","."," Next"," would"," come"," your"," trial",","," this"," could"," be"," up"," to"," years"," after"," your"," arrest",".","\n","Despite"," all"," the"," chaos"," during"," the"," ","1","9","3","0","s"," the"," legal"," system"," was"," still"," a"," vital"," part"," of"," society","."," Unlike"," Nazi"," concentration"," camps"," where"," people"," were"," not"," tried"," before"," ex","hile"," Soviet"," citizens"," received"," trials"," prior"," to"," being"," sent"," to"," concentration"," camps","."," These"," court"," cases"," were"," often"," less"," than"," ","5"," minutes"," in"," length"," however","."," In"," addition"," the"," person"," sentencing"," you"," was"," often"," a"," panel"," of"," ","3"," government"," representatives"," rather"," than"," a"," judge","."," These"," representatives"," were"," being"," pressured"," to"," sentence"," massive"," amounts"," prisoners"," as"," well","."," The"," reason"," for"," needing"," prisoners"," was"," due"," to"," the"," massive"," use"," of"," prison"," labor",","," yet"," prisoners"," were"," dying"," too"," quick"," for"," any"," efficient"," use"," of"," this"," labor"," force","."," So"," due"," to"," the"," fact"," you"," were"," already"," assumed"," guilty"," paired"," with"," the"," need"," for"," labor"," you"," would"," be"," sent"," to"," a"," remote"," concentration"," camp",".","\n","The"," journey"," to"," the"," camp"," would"," most"," likely"," be"," in"," an"," un","heated"," train"," cart"," and"," last"," for"," months","."," You"," would"," only"," be"," allowed"," to"," use"," the"," restroom"," once"," a"," day"," if"," you"," were"," lucky"," and"," begged"," the"," guards","."," You"," would"," not"," receive"," water"," for"," up"," to"," a"," week"," during"," this"," trip"," and"," food"," would"," be"," about"," ","2"," kilos"," of"," bread"," for"," the"," entire"," voyage","."," There"," would"," be"," no"," warm"," clothes","

chance"," you"," would"," be"," gang"," raped"," by"," prisoners"," as"," the"," guards"," observed"," not"," intervening","."," ","\n","Inside"," the"," camp"," itself"," you"," would"," be"," sorted"," as"," either"," fit"," for"," work",","," fit"," for"," light"," work",","," or"," not"," fit"," for"," work","."," If"," you"," were"," not"," fit"," to"," work"," you"," were"," almost"," guaranteed"," dead","."," The"," camps"," ran"," on"," a"," system"," where"," the"," harder"," you"," worked"," the"," more"," you"," ate","."," If"," you"," could"," not"," work"," you"," were"," only"," given"," ","2","0","0"," grams"," of"," food"," a"," day","."," The"," strong"," workers"," were"," given"," upwards"," of"," ","7","0","0"," grams"," of"," bread"," and"," around"," ","1","0","0"," grams"," of"," meat","."," In"," the"," ","1","9","3","0","s"," there"," were"," many"," reforms"," taking"," place"," as"," well","."," If"," you"," were"," present"," in"," the"," early"," ","1","9","3","0","s"," the"," guards"," could"," still"," kill"," you"," for"," no"," reason"," and"," report"," it"," as"," an"," accident","."," Towards"," the"," end"," of"," the"," decade"," Stalin"," impli","mented"," many"," new"," rules"," making"," prison"," life"," easier","."," Examples"," of"," these"," reforms"," are"," the"," introduction"," of"," no"," more","

the"," camps"," there"," was"," also"," not"," a"," guarantee"," you"," would"," be"," set"," free"," once"," your"," sentence"," was"," completed","."," Often"," times"," poor"," record"," keeping","
