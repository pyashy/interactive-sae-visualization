a"," great"," question","."," The"," Supplemental"," Nutrition"," and"," Assistance"," Program",","," or"," SNAP"," is"," seen"," as"," an"," easily"," abused"," hand"," out","."," To"," qualify"," for"," SNAP",","," your"," household"," has"," to"," be"," under"," ","1","3","0"," of"," the"," poverty"," line"," with"," what"," you"," make"," before"," taxes","."," Because"," of"," programs"," that"," aren","'","t"," part"," of"," SNAP"," but"," overlap"," with"," it",","," such"," as"," the"," Earned"," Income"," Credit",","," it","'","s"," easy"," to"," see"," how"," people"," envision"," a"," situation"," where"," bad"," people"," combine"," the"," bare"," minimum"," of"," on","-","the","-","books"," work"," with"," unor","thodox"," living"," situations"," to"," maximize"," their","

requires"," everyone"," in"," the"," household"," to"," report"," their"," income",","," but"," it"," does"," not"," include"," the"," income"," of"," illegal"," immigrants"," while"," still"," counting"," them"," as"," a"," person"," for"," benefits","."," So"," for"," example","."," Let","'","s"," say"," a"," family"," of"," four"," lives"," in"," the"," US",":"," mother",",","

father","'","s"," income"," does"," not"," count"," towards"," household"," income",","," but"," the"," benefits"," are"," still"," awarded"," as"," four"," individuals"," for"," assistance","."," -"," There"," is"," abuse"," in"," the"," system","."," Many"," people"," on"," food"," stamps"," are"," living"," in"," a"," household"," with"," extra"," income"," which"," goes","

and"," the"," boyfriend"," will"," use"," an"," alternate"," address"," so"," they"," can"," continue"," receiving"," government"," assistance","."," They"," may"," even"," forego"," marriage"," to"," stay"," on"," the"," system","."," Additionally",","," people"," who"," work"," for"," cash"," or"," tips"," may"," not"," declare"," all"," of"," their"," income"," and"," receive"," benefits","
