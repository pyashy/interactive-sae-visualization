just"," wanted"," to"," post"," one"," of"," the"," replies"," explaining"," much"," better"," than"," I"," could"," ever"," hope"," to","."," ","\n"," >"," That","'","s"," a"," bit"," misleading"," even"," for"," a"," five","-","year","-","old"," (","who"," is"," not"," literally"," a"," five","-","year","-","old",")."," ","\n","The"," proper"," way"," to"," explain"," it"," is"," saying"," that"," what"," we"," consider"," as"," \"","touch","\""," doesn","'","t"," mean"," the"," same"," thing"," in"," small"," scale"," because"," of"," the"," structure"," of"," matter",","," but"," we"," can"," still"," define"," \"","touch","\""," in"," a"," way"," that"," makes"," sense"," as"," a"," \"","hard"," contact"," between"," objects","\""," even"," in"," situations"," where"," there","'","s"," always"," some"," \"","void","\""," between"," objects","."," ","\n","An"," actual"," explanation"," would"," get"," in"," more"," complicated"," territory"," because"," it"," involves"," looking"," at"," the"," forces"," present"," on"," the"," interface"," between"," two"," objects"," as"," a"," function"," of"," range","."," The"," popular"," misconception"," is"," that"," \"","touch","\""," is"," all"," about"," electromagnetic"," interaction"," between"," objects",","," but"," that","'","s"," not"," really"," true"," -"," at"," certain"," range",","," there"," is"," usually"," an"," attractive"," electric"," force"," (","van"," der"," Wa","als"," force",","," for"," example","),"," which"," animals"," like"," ge","ck","os"," and"," insects"," and"," spiders"," use"," to"," adhere"," to"," surfaces","."," ","\n","Then"," there","'","s"," typically"," a"," point"," where"," the"," force"," is"," zero"," -"," the"," attractive"," force"," and"," repulsive"," force"," balance"," each"," other"," out","."," This"," is"," often"," used"," as"," the"," meaningful"," boundary"," of"," \"","touch","\""," in"," everyday"," world"," -"," this"," is"," the"," point"," where"," the"," pressure"," between"," two"," macroscopic"," objects"," starts"," to"," increase","."," ","\n","As"," the"," objects"," are"," pushed"," further"," forwards",","," the"," electric"," repulsive"," force"," rapidly"," increases",","," which"," is"," what"," is"," responsible"," for"," the"," pressure"," on"," the"," interface"," at"," this"," point","."," Increasing"," the"," pressure"," means"," the"," objects"," get"," a"," bit"," closer",","," until"," the"," electric"," repulsion"," is"," again"," balanced","."," ","\n","However",","," this"," doesn","'","t"," mean"," you"," can"," push"," objects"," towards"," closer"," and"," closer","."," There"," is"," another"," sharp"," increase"," in"," the"," repulsive"," force"," as"," you"," reach"," a"," very"," small"," distance"," between"," the"," individual"," particles"," of"," the"," objects","."," And"," it"," turns"," out"," that"," this"," increased"," repulsive"," force"," is"," not"," produced"," by"," the"," electric"," fields"," of"," the"," electrons"," of"," the"," atoms",","," but"," rather"," by"," the"," Pauli"," exclusion"," principle"," which"," states"," that"," only"," one"," matter","-","particle"," can"," occupy"," a"," certain"," point"," in"," space"," at"," any"," given"," time"," (","to"," be"," more"," accurate",","," two"," or"," more"," fermions"," can","'","t"," have"," the"," same"," quantum"," state"," within"," a"," quantum"," system"," simultaneously",")."," ","\n","This"," means"," that"," there"," really"," is"," a"," distance"," where"," we"," can"," say"," the"," atoms"," are"," \"","touch","ing","\""," because"," they"," can","'","t"," really"," get"," closer"," to"," each"," other"," after"," they"," hit"," the"," distance"," where"," the"," Pauli"," exclusion"," principle"," kicks"," in","."," If"," you"," try"," to"," push"," them"," more"," together"," the"," force"," just"," increases"," further","."," ","\n","Or",","," alternatively",","," you"," increase"," the"," pressure"," so"," much"," that"," the"," atomic"," nuclei"," no"," longer"," have"," individual"," electrons"," and"," instead"," you","'","re"," dealing"," with"," plasma"," on"," the"," interface","."," Which",","," unless"," you"," have"," something"," to"," contain"," it",","," will"," promptly"," escape"," from"," between"," the"," objects","."," ","\n","And"," if"," you"," can"," apply"," even"," more"," pressure"," to"," the"," plasma"," you"," can"," get"," the"," atomic"," nuclei"," so"," close"," to"," each"," other"," that"," they"," really"," do"," touch"," -"," but"," at"," that"," point"," it"," becomes"," energetically"," more"," favourable"," for"," them"," to"," fuse"," together","
