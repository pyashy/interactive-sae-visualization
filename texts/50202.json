to"," get"," to"," in"," air",".","\n","The"," third"," is"," that"," getting"," out"," of"," the"," air"," is"," hard"," enough"," it","'","s"," basically"," space",".","\n","So",","," airplanes"," use"," a"," turb","ofan"," engine"," which"," activates"," a"," mechanical"," reaction"," against"," air"," molecules"," to"," provide"," thrust","."," The"," problem"," being"," that"," a",":"," Their"," thrust"," to"," weight"," ratios"," are"," low",","," meaning"," that"," lift"," must"," be"," attained"," by"," a"," trick"," of"," aer","odynamics"," and"," b",":"," they"," require"," air",".","\n","Now",","," lets"," assume"," we"," have"," some"," kind"," of"," plane"," thats"," really"," big","."," An"," A","3","8","0"," or"," something","."," That"," flies"," at"," about"," ","1","0","km"," up","."," Not"," high"," enough","."," Lets"," get"," to"," ","1","6","km",","," where"," we","'","re"," in"," less"," than"," ","1","0","%"," atmosphere","...."," Oh",","," we"," can","'","t"," because"," our"," air"," breathing"," turb","ofan"," engines"," can","'","t"," work"," up"," here","."," We"," need"," different"," engines"," which"," have"," air"," shoved"," in"," them"," in"," a"," different"," manner",".","\n","Time"," to"," break"," the"," sound"," barrier","."," Turbo","jets"," are"," turb","of","ans",","," but"," capable"," of"," breaking"," the"," sound"," barrier"," (","there"," are"," other"," differ","n","ces",","," but"," please",","," this"," is"," EL","I","5",")."," The"," problem"," is"," that"," they"," only"," go"," up"," to"," about"," ","9","0","0","m","/","s","."," Not"," ","1","1","0","0","0",".","\n","Ram","jets"," use"," the"," shape"," of"," the"," jet"," to"," compress"," the"," air",","," but"," still"," slow","

that"," they"," are"," much",","," much"," more"," limited"," in"," fuel","."," They"," are"," listed"," by"," something"," called"," \"","Delta"," V","\","," which"," is"," a"," measure"," of"," how"," much"," change"," in"," velocity"," they"," can"," achieve","."," A"," delta"," V"," of"," ","1","1","km","/","s"," is"," needed"," to"," get"," away"," from"," earth",".","\n","Even","

","1","0","-","1","1","km","/","s","."," So"," we"," lifted"," it"," up",","," but"," now"," our"," plane"," is"," going"," sideways"," at"," say",","," a"," ston","king"," mach"," ","1","0",".","\n","We"," still"," need"," ","7","km","/","s"," delta"," V"," to"," get"," into"," space","."," We","'","ve"," taking"," our"," rocket"," design",","," made"," it"," significantly","

to"," get"," to"," space"," on"," the"," cheap",":"," Linear"," catapult","."," This"," is"," a"," massive"," linear"," motor"," like"," that"," in"," high"," speed"," trains"," that"," is"," used"," to"," accelerate"," a"," load"," at"," ","1","-","3","g"," until"," it"," reaches"," ","1","1","km","/","s"," then"," it"," shoots"," out"," into"," space"," like"," a"," bullet","."," This","
