which"," means"," that"," people"," are"," paying"," off"," debt"," more"," slowly"," and"," are"," therefore"," holding"," onto"," money","."," Def","lation"," is"," generally"," not"," good"," for"," an"," economy"," because"," it"," decreases"," the"," value"," of"," money",","," which"," reduces"," the"," purchasing"," power"," of"," the"," money","."," A"," falling"," currency"," decreases"," the"," incentive"," to"," save"," or"," invest",","," and"," therefore"," can"," cause"," a"," depression","."," The"," causes"," of"," inflation"," and"," deflation"," often"," have","
