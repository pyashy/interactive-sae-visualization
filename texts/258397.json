you"," need"," to"," address"," -"," with"," your"," own"," personality"," and"," experience","."," That","'","s"," why"," so"," many"," people"," who"," have"," mental"," illnesses"," struggle","

just"," what","'","s"," going"," on"," inside"," themselves","."," And"," while"," many"," people"," would"," prefer"," that"," psychologists"," take"," care"," of"," fixing"," their","

Fewer"," than"," ","1","0"," of"," prescriptions"," continue"," to"," be"," filled"," every"," year","."," Some"," physicians"," say"," they"," refuse"," to"," prescribe"," them"," purely"," because"," they"," fear"," getting"," sued"," by"," patients","'"," families","."," Others"," blame"," high"," costs","."," Still"," others"," cite"," clinical"," trials"," showing"," minimal","
