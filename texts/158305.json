{"text_id":158305,"tokens":["Massive"," spoilers"," below","."," I"," just"," finished"," the"," book"," version"," of"," The"," Martian",","," which"," has"," Mark"," Wat","ney",","," a"," NASA","

has"," to"," do"," with"," the"," ending"," of"," the"," book","."," The"," author"," leaves"," Wat","ney"," stranded",","," with"," the"," crew"," coming"," back"," to"," rescue"," him","."," In"," the"," movie",","," Wat","ney"," is"," rescued","."," The"," movie"," is"," being"," made"," by"," ","2","0","th"," Century"," Fox",","," while"," the"," book"," is"," published"," by"," Random"," House","."," If"," the"," book"," was"," published"," by"," ","2","0","th"," Century"," Fox",","," it"," is"," not"," possible"," to"," legally"," produce"," an"," ending"," different"," from"," the"," movie",","," but"," because"," the"," two"," works"," are"," produced"," by"," different"," companies",","," the"," book"," has"," a"," different"," ending","."," Now",","," I"," understand"," that"," the"," movie"," could"," be"," a"," huge"," success"," and"," spawn"," a"," whole"," series"," of"," movies","."," But",","," because"," the"," book"," is"," so"," different",","," would"," the"," first"," movie"," be"," different"," enough"," from"," the"," book"," that"," a"," sequel"," would"," require"," the"," author"," to"," write"," another"," book",","," which"," would"," have"," to"," be"," a"," \"","pre","quel","\""," to"," the"," first"," one","?"," I"," guess"," that","'","s"," one"," of"," the"," ways"," the"," book"," and"," movie"," could"," differ","."," I"," am"," not"," an"," expert"," on"," copyright"," law",","," but"," I","'","m"," pretty"," sure"," that"," the"," two"," works"," could"," have"," different"," endings","."," I"," wonder"," what"," the","

as"," a"," greeting"," to"," each"," other","."," It"," was"," so"," frequent",","," it"," was"," distracting","."," I","'","m"," curious"," if"," the"," author"," knew"," the"," word"," was"," so","

book",","," but"," never"," mention"," the"," fact"," that"," there"," is"," a"," whole"," section"," at"," the"," end"," of"," the"," book"," after"," Wat","ney"," is"," saved","."," I"," guess"," most"," people"," don","'","t"," read"," the"," end"," of"," books","."," What"," about"," that"," last"," part"," in"," the"," book","."," Was"," he"," just"," dreaming"," it"," or"," did"," they","

they"," have"," so"," much"," time"," and"," energy"," to"," film"," an"," entire"," ","1","9","7","0","s"," movie"," on"," Mars","."," I","'","m"," guessing"," it"," was"," part"," of"," the","

and"," the"," movie","."," I"," feel"," like"," they","'","re"," both"," great"," in"," their"," own"," ways"," and"," it","'","s"," cool"," that"," they","'","re"," different","."," The"," book"," is"," more"," like"," a"," scientific"," journal"," and"," the"," movie"," is"," more"," like"," an"," action"," movie","."," I"," think"," if"," the"," movie"," were"," like"," the"," book",","," it"," would"," have"," been"," so"," boring"," and"," I"," don","'","t"," think"," it"," would"," have"," done"," well"," at"," all","."," But"," I"," love"," that"," the"," book"," is"," the","
