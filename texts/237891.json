{"text_id":237891,"tokens":["First"," of"," all",","," the"," law"," I","'","m"," referring"," to"," isn","'","t"," the"," law"," of"," any"," particular"," country",","," just"," laws"," in"," general","."," Imagine"," sitting"," on"," the"," bus"," when"," an"," elderly"," woman"," comes"," in","."," She"," is"," dressed"," well"," and"," her"," clothes"," are"," clean"," and"," pressed","."," As"," she"," sits"," down"," she"," starts"," fan","ning"," herself",";"," you"," can"," tell"," that"," she","'","s"," not"," feeling"," too"," good"," and"," she"," might"," be"," sick"," or"," have"," a"," medical"," condition"," which"," has"," made"," her"," feel"," unwell","."," You"," don","'","t"," know"," where"," this"," old"," lady"," came"," from"," but"," since"," she"," looks"," like"," she"," could"," use"," some"," help"," you"," offer"," to"," give"," her"," your"," seat","."," You"," would"," probably"," get"," in"," trouble"," if"," it"," were"," legal"," for"," people"," to"," take"," seats"," from"," strangers"," without"," asking"," politely"," first","."," The"," reason"," why"," we"," generally"," don","'","t"," do"," this"," is"," because"," most"," countries"," have"," rules"," about"," taking"," other"," peoples","'"," stuff"," unless"," they"," ask"," nicely","."," It"," may"," become"," a"," different"," story"," later"," though"," as"," more"," and"," more"," places"," start"," adopting"," universal","ism"," (","for"," example"," by"," making"," our"," seats"," into"," \"","public"," property","\""," rather"," than"," something"," owned"," by"," individuals",")."," Universal","ist"," policies"," tend"," to"," find"," their"," way"," into"," nations"," with"," totalitarian"," governments"," sooner"," than"," those"," who"," choose"," to"," go"," individual","istic"," and"," leave"," personal"," property"," alone"," to"," protect"," minorities"," such"," as"," religious"," groups","."," Anyway",","," back"," to"," my"," point","."," If"," there"," wasn","'","t"," already"," enough"," confusion",","," what"," happens"," next"," makes"," things"," even"," worse",":"," Universal","ists"," also"," refuse"," to"," respect"," property"," rights"," even"," if"," the"," owner"," does"," consent","!"," Take"," note"," that"," a"," lot"," of"," them"," will"," try"," to"," make"," up"," reasons"," to"," justify"," these"," actions"," instead","."," Examples"," include"," how"," bad","-","manner","ed"," people"," really"," don","'","t"," care"," whether"," someone"," else","'","s"," sofa"," cushion"," smells"," funny"," or"," will"," he","she"," eventually"," need"," it"," anyway"," so"," why"," should"," they"," pay"," for"," it","?"," This"," one"," is"," especially"," common"," among"," hippie"," types"," and"," \"","urban"," explorers",".\""," Another"," example"," given"," by"," universal","ists"," themselves"," is"," the"," fact"," that"," leaving"," trash"," lying"," around"," is"," disrespectful"," (","the"," article"," itself"," mentions"," lit","tering",")"," despite"," the"," fact"," that"," no"," one"," owns"," these"," spaces"," except"," us"," citizens","

long"," as"," the"," activity"," was"," carried"," out"," peacefully",")."," Also"," worth"," mentioning"," here"," is"," that"," many"," universal","ists"," claim"," that"," private"," property"," only"," exists"," as"," far"," as"," corporations"," allow"," because"," corporations"," should"," own"," everything"," while"," humans"," shouldn","'","t","."," However",","," I","'","ve"," seen"," plenty"," of"," instances"," where"," companies"," use"," the"," excuse"," '","our"," policy"," says","..."," \""," to"," defend"," doing"," whatever"," they"," please"," regardless"," of"," consent"," of"," owners","."," So"," while"," you"," hit"," me"," over"," the"," head"," with"," examples"," of"," right"," w","ingers"," being"," intolerant"," towards"," minorities",","," I"," present"," you"," with"," a"," much"," better"," argument"," against"," liberal"," thinking",":"," A"," person"," must"," realize"," that"," others"," might"," hold"," views"," contrary"," to"," his"," or"," hers"," at"," times"," (","most"," likely"," caused"," by"," differences"," in"," culture",","," religion"," and"," lifestyle"," listen"," again",","," most"," liberals"," believe","

as"," long"," as"," you"," adhere"," to"," whatever"," ideology","."," Sorry",","," but"," that"," simply"," doesn","'","t"," fly","."," My"," book"," ends"," with"," two"," factors"," I"," think","
