There"," are"," three"," types",":"," corner"," pieces",","," edge"," pieces",","," and"," center"," pieces","."," Corner"," pieces"," have"," three"," colored"," stickers"," and"," are"," located"," on"," the"," corners"," of"," the"," cube","."," Edge"," pieces"," have"," two"," colored"," stickers"," and"," are"," located"," in"," the"," middle"," of"," each"," edge","."," Center"," pieces","

the"," direction"," of"," the"," arrow",","," while"," counter","clockwise"," means"," turning"," it"," in"," the"," opposite"," direction","."," Additionally",","," if"," you"," want"," to"," turn","
